### **Part 1: Choose Three Tentative Topics**

*Topics:*
1. African American Cowboys on the Frontier

I found this topic surfing JSTOR during our AML in-class activity. My initial research suggests African American cowboys played a prominent role in cowboy culture in the West, but are often overlooked. It also showed that the results of segregation played a part in this culture, which may make looking at the Reconstruction Era in relation to African American Cowboys interesting.

2. Cartographical Advancements on the Frontier

I was looking around a bunch of maps during our archive tour in Terrell library, and found a lot of interesting maps. One older French one had some major landmarks we see today, but was totally out of scale and had fantasy lands/passages that didn't exist. Some others showed small settlements, cities, and mountains. My initial research suggests cartography had great importance for navigating on the frontier, and European settlers often benefited from Native American's understanding of the land.

3. Ghost towns: Small communities on the frontier, their formation, and dissipation

I was looking at various smaller settlements in Washington (near the Colville reservation specifically) during our archive, and was wondering how many were still around. Some of the major cities (especially those near major waterways or resource zones) were still around, but a lot were gone to history.

### **Part 2: Formulate Research Questions**

*Questions:*

1. How does African American cowboy culture shape our modern understanding and stereotypes of cowboys on the frontier? What aspects of African American cowboy culture are often overlooked?

Learning more about African American cowboy culture, both what remains today and what is overlooked, can give us deeper insight into the cultural diversity of the frontier, the different roles African American cowboys took on (such as cooking), and the changing African American identity amidst segregation.

2. How did the interactions between various cultures and groups contribute to the cartographical advancements on the frontier?

Understanding more about the maps that were made on the frontier could tell us more about how the different diverse cultures melted/interacted together. For instance, the Natives and their ancestral expertise with the European settlers and their tools.

3. How did little settlements in the West form and dissipate? What their life cycle looked like, and how did resources/transportation contribute to the dissipation of many of these settlements?

Understanding the life cycles of small towns could give us greater insight to what frontier life really looked like on small settlements and how people moved around between areas.
