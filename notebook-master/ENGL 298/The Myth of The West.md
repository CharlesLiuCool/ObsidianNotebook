- Daniel Boone was a folktale hero for exploring areas of the west
- Later got involved in legal squabbles and lost his land
- Liked Indians more although he fought them, said they treated him better
- The Frontier became (naturally) associated with fighting Indians as they were merely defending their ancestral land
- However Daniel Boone forces us to reconsider this
- Myth isn't representing wholly false, rather not the whole picture
- "The most potent recurring hero-figures in our mythologies are men in whom contradictory identities find expression" - Slotkin
- "good-badmen"
- Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett had been spun into various fantasy stories where they beat "savage redskins" or other standard plots
- Other real people were also spun into "dime-novels". Readers had trouble recognizing the fiction, but it brought about public thought such as with one story of Calamity Jane where she demanded equal rights

**Chapter 15: “The Myth of the West”** examines how the American West has been mythologized as a land of endless opportunity and rugged individualism, a narrative shaped by popular culture, literature, and scholarly influence. Drawing on the Turner Frontier Thesis and scholars like Richard Slotkin, the authors contrast the mythical West with the actual historical complexity of the frontier—highlighting ethnic conflict, environmental hardship, economic instability, and cultural diversity. The chapter challenges the myth, showing how it simplifies and romanticizes the West, and calls on readers to appreciate the true, layered history behind the legend.
