### **Linear Algebra + Lattices**

>**Definition** Lattice
>A *lattice* $\mathcal{L}$ in $\Bbb{R}^n$ is a set of points in $n$-dimensional space generated by all linear combinations of a set of linear independent vectors.
>
Formally, if $\textbf{b}_1, \textbf{b}_2, ..., \textbf{b}_n \in \Bbb{R}^n$ are linearly independent vectors, then the lattice generated by them is:
$$\mathcal{L}(B) = \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^nz_ib_i: z_i \in \Bbb{Z}\right\}$$
>
We also call $\textbf{B} = [b_1,...,b_n]$ is called the *basis* of a lattice.

>**Definition** Dual Lattice
>Let $\Lambda \subset \Bbb{R}^n$ be a full-rank lattice. The *dual lattice* $\Lambda^*$ is defined as
>$$\Lambda^* := \{y \in \Bbb{R}^n : \langle y,x \rangle \in \Bbb{Z} \;\forall \; x \in \Lambda\}$$
>That is $\Lambda^*$  consists of all vectors that have integer inner products with every vector in $\Lambda$

>**Definition** Determinant of Lattice
>The determinant of $\Lambda$, denoted $\det(\Lambda)$, is the volume of the fundamental parelellepiped spanned by basis vectors $b_1, ..., b_n$
>$$\mathcal{P}(B) = \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \alpha_i b_i : 0 \le \alpha_1 < 1\right\}$$
>Formally:
>$$\det(\Lambda) := \text{Vol}(\mathcal{P}(B)) = |\det(B)|$$
>where $B$ is the $n \times n$ matrix whose columns are the basis vectors.

>**Definition** Positive Definite Matrix
>A real symmetric $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is *positive definite* if for every non-zero vector $x \in \Bbb{R}^n$:
>$$x^TAx > 0$$
>Notice that $x^TAx$ is a scalar.

### **Number Fields**

>**Definition** Number Field
>A *number field* $K$ is a field such that
>$$\Bbb{Q} \subset K \text{ and } [K : \Bbb{Q}]$$
>denotes the degree of extension (the dimension of $K$ as a vector space over $\Bbb{Q}$)

___

### **Cyclotomic Fields**

>**Definition** Root of Unity
>A *$n$-th root of unity* is a complex number $\zeta$ that satisfies
>$$\zeta^n = 1$$
>
>We can write all $n$-th roots of unity as
>$$1, \zeta, \zeta^2, ..., \zeta^{n-1}$$
>where
>$$\zeta = e^{2\pi i/n}$$

>**Definition** Primitive $n$-th Root of Unity
>A $n$-th root of unity $\zeta$ is *primitive* is not a root of unity for any smaller positive power. Specifically, it is primitive if
>$$\zeta^k \neq 1 \; \forall\; 1 \le k < n$$
>Equivalently, $\zeta = e^{2\pi i k /n}$ is primitive if $\gcd(k,n) = 1$

Recall the identity
>**Definition** Euler's Formula
>For any complex number $z = a + bi$, $$e^{ri\theta} = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$$ where $a = r\cos\theta$ and $b = r\sin\theta$, and $r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

>**Definition** $m$-th Cyclotomic Field
>For a positive integer $m$, the *$m$-th cyclotomic field* is the field obtained by adjoining a primitive $m$-th root of unity to the rational numbers $\Bbb{Q}$. This is denoted
>$$\Bbb{Q}(\zeta_m)$$
>where $\zeta_m$ is a complex number satisfying
>$$(\zeta_m)^m = 1 \text{ and } (\zeta_m)^k \neq 1 \text{ for }1 \le k < m$$
>In other words, $\zeta_m$ is a primitive $m$-th root of unity.
>The *ring of integers* of this field is
>$$R = \Bbb{Z}[\zeta_m] = \{a_0 + a_1\zeta_m + ... +a_{N-1}\zeta_m^{N-1} \,|\, a_i \in \Bbb{Z}\}, \; \text{where } N =\varphi(m)$$

What that means is the $m$-th cyclotomic polynomial is just the minimum field required to add the $m$-th primitive root in while preserving the fact that it is a field.

### **Ideals**

>**Definition** Cosets (Ring/Ideals)
>Let $R$ be a ring (commutative with 1) and $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq R$ be an ideal.
>Then $R$ is an *additive abelian group* and $\mathfrak{a}$ is a subgroup under addition.
>A coset of $\mathfrak{a}$ in $R$ is
>$$r + \mathfrak{a} := \{r + a | a \in a\}, \; r\in R$$

>**Definition** Quotient Ring
>Let $R$, $\mathfrak{a}$ be as defined above. The quotient ring $R/\mathfrak{a}$ is the set of cosets
>$$R/\mathfrak{a} = \{r + \mathfrak{a} \,|\, r\in R\}$$

>**Definition** Ideals
>Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $I \subseteq R$ is called an *ideal* if
>1. $I$ forms an additive subgroup. That is, $I$ is closed under addition ($a,b \in I \implies a+b \in I$) and $I$ contains additive inverses $a \in I \implies -a \in I$
>2. $I$ follows "absorbing multiplication". That is, for every $r \in R$ and $a \in I$, the product $ra \in I$
>We denote $I \triangleleft R$ to mean $I$ is an ideal of $R$

>**Definition** Principal Ideal
> A *principal ideal* is an ideal generated by a single element $a \in R$
> $$(a) = aR = \{ar \,|\, r \in R\}$$

>**Definition** Prime Ideal
>A *prime ideal* $I \subset R$ is an ideal other than $R$ itself such that whenever $ab \in I$, at least one of $a \in I$ or $b \in I$.

>**Definition** Ideal Factorization
>Let $R$ be the ring of integers in a number field $K$, and let $I \subseteq R$ be an ideal.
>An ideal factorization is an expression of $I$ as a product of prime ideals of $R$
>$$I = \mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1}\mathfrak{p}_2^{e_2}...\mathfrak{p_n^{e_n}}$$
>Note each $\mathfrak{p}_i$ is called a *ideal factor*.

>**Definition** Ideal Norm
>Given an ideal factor $\mathfrak{p}$ for a ring of integers $R$, we say its *ideal norm* is
>$$\mathcal{N}(\mathfrak{p}) = |R/\mathfrak{p}|$$
>That is, the number of distinct cosets of $\mathfrak{p} \in R$
>Note that in number fields, this always comes out as a power of the rational prime $p$ lying below $\mathfrak{p}$ (the prime $p$ where $pR = \mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1}\mathfrak{p}_2^{e_2}...\mathfrak{p_n^{e_n}}$)

### **Abstract Algebra Fundamentals**

> **Definition** Field
> A field $F$ is a commutative ring with unity in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.

It is stronger than an integral domain

>**Definition** Integral Domain

### **Discrete Gaussian**

>**Definition** Periodic Gaussian
We define the function $p_s: \Bbb{R}^n \to \Bbb{R}$ by

>**Definition** Discrete Gaussian
>For a full-rank lattice $\mathcal{L} \subset \Bbb{R}^n$, $s > 0$ and $t \in \Bbb{R}^n$, the *discrete Gaussian distribution* $D_{\mathcal{L}+t,s}$ has probability mass function $\Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{D}_{\{\mathcal{L}+t,s\}}}[X=x] = \frac{\rho_s(x)}{\rho_s(\mathcal{L}+t)}$ if $x \in \mathcal{L} + t$ and $0$ otherwise

___

### **Entropy**

>**Definition** Smooth min-entropy
>Given $\epsilon \ge 0$, the $\epsilon$-smooth min-entropy of random variable $X$ is
>$$H^{\epsilon}_\infty(X) := \max_{X':\Delta(X,X')\le \epsilon}H_\infty(X')$$

We can smooth away $\epsilon$ probability mass and consider the maximal min-entropy of the new $X'$ which is reasonably close to $X$

___

### **Poisson**

>**Definition** Poisson Summation Formula
>For a lattice $L \subset \Bbb{R}^n$ and a nice function $f$, we get:
$$\sum\limits_{x \in L}f(x) = \frac{1}{\det(L)} \sum\limits_{y \in L}\hat{f}(y)$$
where $L^*$ is the dual lattice and $\hat{f}$ is the Fourier transform of $f$.

The idea behind Poisson summation is over a dual lattice, the summation of the Fourier transform divided by the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the basis of the lattice (a normalization value) is equal to the summation of the "nice" function.

>**Lemma** Poisson on Gaussian
>Take $f(x) = e^{-\pi||x||^2/\sigma^2} = \rho_\sigma(x)$. Its Fourier transform is
>$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \sigma^n e^{-\pi \sigma^2 ||\xi||^2} = \sigma^n \rho_{1/\sigma} (\xi)$$
>We thus get for standard lattice $L = \Bbb{Z}^n$
>$$\rho_\sigma(\Bbb{Z}^n) = \sum\limits_{x \in \Bbb{Z}^n} \rho_\sigma(x) = \sigma^n \sum\limits_{y \in \Bbb{Z}^n} = \sigma^n \rho_{1/\sigma}(\Bbb{Z}^n)$$

___

### **Tail Bound Theorems**

>**Definition** Banaszczyk Tail Bound For Discrete Gaussians
>For a lattice $\Lambda \subset \Bbb{R}^n$, any shift $c \in \Bbb{R}^n$, and parameter $\sigma > 0$, the discrete Gaussian
>$$D_{\Lambda, \sigma, c}(x) \propto \text{exp}\left(-\pi \frac{||x-c||^2}{\sigma^2}\right)$$
>has the property that for any $t > 0$
>$$\Pr_{x\sim D_{\Lambda,\sigma,c}}[||x-c|| > \sigma\sqrt{n} + t] \le \text{exp}\left(-\pi \frac{t^2}{\sigma^2}\right)$$

This means that the shortest representatives hold the highest weight in the Gaussian, and the Gaussian is heavily concentrated there. Farther points decay *subgaussianly* with distance.

___

### **Other Theorems**

>**Definition** Dedekind Theorem (structure of prime ideals lying above a rational prime)
>If $K = \Bbb{Q}(\zeta)$ is a number field with minimal polynomial $f(x)$, then the way a prime number $q$ factors in $\mathcal{O}_K$ can be read off from the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo $q$.
>
$$f(x) \equiv F_1(x)^{e_1}F_2(x)^{e_2}...F_g(x)^{e_g} \pmod q$$
>
>with $F_i$ irreducible in $\Bbb{F}_q[x]$
>Then $$q\mathcal{O}_K = \mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1}...\mathfrak{p}_g^{e_g}$$
>where each $\mathfrak{p}_i = \langle q, F_i(\zeta) \rangle$ is a prime ideal in $\mathcal{O}_k$, and its norm satisfies
>$$\mathcal{N}(\mathfrak{p}_i) = q^{\text{deg}(F_i)}$$
>Dedekind's theorem thus tells us that prime ideals over $q$ can be written as
>$$\langle q, F_i(\zeta)\rangle = \{ a\cdot q + b \cdot F_i(\zeta) \,|\, a,b \in \mathcal{O}_K \}$$
