We want to represent the superposition of quantum states into a single notation encapsulating the full idea.

Dirac introduced the notation of bra and ket, coming from "bracket"
$$\langle\text{bra} | \text{ket}\rangle$$

>**Definition** Ket (Quantum State)
>A ket, $|\phi\rangle$, is simply a vector in a Hilbert space $H$.
