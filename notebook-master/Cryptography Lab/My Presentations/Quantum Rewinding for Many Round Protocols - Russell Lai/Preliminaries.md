>Let $s \in \Bbb{R}$ and $t \in [n]$. A set $R \subseteq \mathcal{R}$ is said to be $(s,t)$-subtractive if for any $t$-subset $T = \{r_i\}_{i\in\Bbb{Z}_i} \subseteq R$, it holds that $s \in \langle \det(V_T) \rangle$ ($\exists$ r where $s = r \cdot \det(V_T)$, or $\det(V_T)$ divides $s$ in the ring $\mathcal{R}$). If $\mathcal{R}$ is $(1,2)$-subtractive, we simply say that $\mathcal{R}$ is subtractive.

Furthermore, for any ordered set $T = (r_0,r_1,r_2) \subseteq R$  and any $x_0, x_1, x_2 \in R$ with $||x_j|| \le \beta$,

>**Definition** Unitary Operation
>A *unitary operation* is a complex square matrix $U$ such that $UU^\dagger = \textbf{I}$. The operation $U$ transforms the pure state $| \psi \rangle$ to the pure state $U |\psi\rangle$, and the density matrix $\rho$ to the density matrix $U\rho U^{\dagger}$.

>**Definition** Projector
>A *projector* $\Pi$ is a Hermitian operator ($\Pi^{\dagger} = \Pi$) such that $\Pi^2 = \Pi$.
>*For More Intuition:* [[Projectors and Projective Measurements in Hilbert Spaces]]

>**Definition** Projective Measurement
>A *projective measurement* $P = (\Pi_i)_{i \in S}$ (where $S$ is the set of all possible measurement outcomes) such that $\sum\limits_{i \in S} \Pi_i = \textbf{I}$. this implies that $\Pi_i\Pi_j = 0$ for distinct $i$ and $j$ in $S$.

The application of $P$ to a pure state $| \psi \rangle$ yields outcome $i \in S$ with probability $p_i = ||\Pi_i | \psi \rangle||^2$.

In this case the *post-measurement state* is $|\psi_i\rangle = \Pi_i |\psi \rangle / \sqrt{p_i}$.
When you obtain outcome $i$, the wavefunction collapses into the part of $|\psi\rangle$, creating a new unnormalized post-measurement state $\Pi_i|\psi\rangle$

To normalize, we see the norm squared is exactly $p_i$
$$\langle \psi | \Pi_i^\dagger \Pi_i | \psi \rangle = \langle \psi|\Pi_i |\psi\rangle = p_i$$

(Recall probability of obtaining outcome $i$ is $p_i = \langle \psi | \Pi_i | \psi \rangle$)

So after normalization, we get
$$|\psi_i \rangle = \dfrac{\Pi_i |\psi\rangle}{\sqrt{p_i}}$$

>**Theorem**
>A state $|\psi\rangle$ is an *eigenstate* of $P$ if it is an eigenstate of every $\Pi_i$.

>**Definition** Binary Projective Measurement
>A two-outcome projective measurement is called a *binary projective measurement* and is written as $P = (\Pi, \textbf{I}- \Pi)$, where $\Pi$ is associated with the outcome $a$ and $\textbf{I} - \Pi$ with the outcome $0$.

>**Definition** Completely-Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) map
>General (non-unitary) evolution of a quantum state can be represented via a *completely-positive trace-preserving* (CPTP) map $T: S(\mathcal{H}) \to S(\mathcal{H}')$
>
>It satisfies the properties that it is *trace-preserving,* which means for every $\rho \in S(\mathcal{H})$, it holds that $\text{Tr}(T(\rho)) = \text{Tr}(\rho)$, and *linear*.
> 
> *For More Intuition:* [[CPTP and General Evolution]]

For every CPTP map $T$: $S(\mathcal{H}) \to S(\mathcal{H})$, there exists a *unitary dilation* that operates on an expanded Hilbert space $\mathcal{H} \otimes \mathcal{K}$, so that $\text{T}(\rho) = \text{Tr}_{\mathcal{K}}(U(\rho \otimes |0\rangle \langle 0|^{\mathcal{K}})U^{\dagger}$). This is *not necessarily unique*.


If $T$ is described as a circuit then there is a dilation $U_T$ represented by a circuit of size $O(|T|)$

>**Definition** Partial Trace
>Let $\rho_{AB}$ be a density operator on $\mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B$.
>The partial trace over $B$ is the unique map
>$$\text{Tr}_B: S(\mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B) \to S(\mathcal{H}_A)$$
>such that for product states:
>$$\text{Tr}_B(\rho_A \otimes \rho_B) = (\text{Tr}\rho_B) \rho_A$$
>
>*For More Intuition:* [[Partial Trace]]

For Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}$, the *partial trace* over $\mathcal{B}$ is the unique CPTP map $\text{Tr}_{\mathcal{B}}: S(A \otimes B) \to S(\mathcal{A})$ such that $\text{Tr}_{\mathcal{B}}(\rho_A \otimes \rho_B) = \text{Tr}(\rho_B)\rho_A$ for every $\rho_A \in S(\mathcal{A})$ and $\rho_B \in S(\mathcal{B})$.

>**Definition** General Measurement
>A *general measurement* is a CPTP map $M: S(\mathcal{H}) \to S(\mathcal{H} \otimes \mathcal{O})$ where $\mathcal{O}$ is an ancilla register holding a classical outcome. Specifically, given measurement operators $\{M_i\}_{i=1}^N$ such that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n M_i^\dagger M_i = \bf{I}$ and a basis $\{|i\rangle\}_{i=1}^N$ for $\mathcal{O}$, $$M(\rho) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N(M_i\rho M_i^\dagger \otimes |i\rangle\langle i|^\mathcal{O})$$
>A measurement induces a probability distribution over its outcomes given by $$\text{Pr}[i] = \text{Tr}(|i\rangle\langle i|^{\mathcal{O}}M(\rho))$$
>We denote sampling from this distribution by
>$$i \in M(\rho)$$
>*For More Intuition:* [[General Measurements]]
>Russell Lai sometimes implicitly discards the outcome register
>
>*Note*: Russell Lai writes $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n M_i M_i^{\dagger} = \bf{I}$, which is WRONG! That's the Heisenberg interpretation, but later he switches back to Schrödinger. Trace is cyclic, not commutative!

A *projective measurement* is a general measurement where the $M_i$ are projectors.

>**Definition** Trace Distance
>The *trace distance* between states $\rho$, $\sigma$, denoted $d(\rho,\sigma)$, is defined as
>$$d(\rho,\sigma) = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}\left(\sqrt{(\rho-\sigma)^2}\right)$$
>*For More Intuition*: [[Trace Distance]]

>**Theorem** Trace Distance under CPTP Maps is Contractive
>The trace distance is *contractive* under CPTP maps. That means for any CPTP map $T$, $$d(T(\rho), T(\sigma)) \le d(\rho, \sigma)$$ It follows that for any measurement $M$, the statistical distance between the distributions $M(\rho)$ and $M(\sigma)$ is bounded by $d(\rho, \sigma)$.

>**Definition** Quantum Computational Distinguishability.
>For states $\rho, \sigma$,
>$$d_{\text{comp}} := \max_{D,|D| \le N} |\text{Pr}[D(\rho) \to 1] - \text{Pr}[D(\sigma)]\to 1|$$
