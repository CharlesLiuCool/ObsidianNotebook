Pseudorandom generator
G

${Pr[D(r) = 1] - Pr[D(G(s) = 1)] \le negl(n)}$
${G_l(s) = G(s,1^{l(|s|)})}$
${c:= G(k,1^{|m|}) + m, m := G(k,1^{|k|}) + c}$

Secure-fixed length scheme


Security for multiple encryption schemes (message vectors)
Deterministic encryption = autofail

Stream ciphers
synchronized/unsynchronized
point: one style of encryption, but we normally use block ciphers under the hood

CPA secure encryption schemes
get multiple encryption security for free
also arbitrary length
