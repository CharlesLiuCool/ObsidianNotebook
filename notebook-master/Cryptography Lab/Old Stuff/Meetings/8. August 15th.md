- MaxCut, explain how to derandomize with conditional expectations and pairwise independence
- Tail Bound Proposition
- Chebyshev Inequality
- Error Reduction

Key things to consider:
- When presenting, use the following order
	- Theorem
	- High level goal of proof
	- Algorithm construction
	- Analysis

Things I want to look at (again):
Concretize Goldreich Levin Full Proof
Schwartz-Zippel Lemma Full Proof
