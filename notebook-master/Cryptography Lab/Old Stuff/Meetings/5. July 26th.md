Random variable -> function map defined on sample space
Why not use oracle as input? Then distinguisher would have to have exponential power, which is against assumption.

Look into
1. Pairwise independent Hash
$h: |N| \to |M|$
$\underset{h\in H}{\Pr}[h(i) = k \wedge h(j) = l] = \frac{1}{|M|^2}$

$i\neq j \in N, k,l \in M$

2. Universal Hash
3. Chapter 8 Theoretical Construction of Symmetry Tag Primitives
4. Number Theory + Cryptography
5. One-Way Functions
Polynomial time to compute, hard to reverse/invert
$f:\{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}^*$
${\exists M_f(x) = f(x) \forall x}$
$\exists \text{ negl}(n), \Pr[Invert_{A,f}(n)=1]=\text{negl}(n)$
