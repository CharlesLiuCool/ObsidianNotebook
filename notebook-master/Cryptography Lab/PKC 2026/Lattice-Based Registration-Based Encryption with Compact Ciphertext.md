>*High Level Overview*:
>This paper contributes a new lattice-based RBE construction inspired by *homomorphic encodings*, significantly improving practical efficiency by achieving the first lattice-based construction with compact ciphertexts around $148$ kilobytes. It also achieves up to $18$ times faster encryption speed and $24$ times fast decryption speed.

>Drawbacks: Slightly slower runtime but since it its a run once and done, seems reasonable.
