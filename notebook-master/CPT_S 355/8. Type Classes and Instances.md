### **Type class**

 - A *type class* in Haskell defines a set of functions that different types can implement
 - Define behavior that can be shared across different types

For instance, the Integral type class defines operations for integral numbers
Integer is a data type in Haskell, which is an instance of the Integral type class.

```hs
--must implement all of the below
--plus whatever's in Real since Integral is a instance of Real
class Real a => Integral a where
	quot :: a -> a -> a
	rem :: a -> a -> a
	div :: a -> a -> a
	mod :: a -> a -> a
	quotRem :: a -> a -> (a,a)
	divMod :: a -> a -> (a,a)
	toInteger a -> a
```

### **Maybe vs Either**

`Maybe` and `Either` are typeclasses.

Use `Maybe` when there is one thing that can go wrong

Use `Either` when there is multiple things that can go wrong

`fmap` is how you "unwrap" the `Maybe` off of the output of the second part.
