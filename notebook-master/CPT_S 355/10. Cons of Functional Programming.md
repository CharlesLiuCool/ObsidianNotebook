### **Tail Call**

- A tail call is a *function call* that occurs at the last call of a function

### **Tail Call Optimization**

- *Tail call optimization (TCO)* is a technique used by compilers or interpreters to optimize recursive function calls
- It reuses the current function stack from for a tail call, reducing the risk of stack overflow

*Benefits:*
- Less stack space, prevents stack overflow
- Reuses stack space
- Improves performance: optimizes memory usage, enabling faster execution of recursive functions
- Not all recursive functions can be optimized with TCO

### **Cons of Functional Programming**

- When you approach a problem recursively, without tail call optimization, you use a ton of stack frames and run out of stack space
- Haskell resolves this by moving extra stuff (thunk) to heap and using lazy evaluation, but this means its hard to evaluate how hard it takes for something to evaluate
