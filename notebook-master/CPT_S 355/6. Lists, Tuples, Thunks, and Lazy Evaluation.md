### **Fundamental Data Structures**

- List
- Tuples

### **Tuples**

- A *tuple* is a fixed-size collection of elements
- Can have different type elements
- Immutable
- Size fixed after creation

Syntax: `(item1, item 2, item3)`

If two element tuple, `(item1, item2)`
Can use `fst` to get first element, `snd` to get second element

### **Lists**

- A *list* is a collection of elements of the same type
- In other words, it is homogeneous
- Size can grow dynamically through operations
	- It's still immutable!

### **Lazy Evaluation**

For a list like `x = [1..100]`
This is called a *thunk*
it only evaluates a certain portion when you touch it
e.g. `take 5` will now modify the heaps and generate the $5$ elements and update the thunk.

### **List Comprehension**

*List comprehension* is a concise way to construct lists
Inspired by set notation in mathematics

`[expression | element <- list, condition]`

### **Multiple Generators**

- Haskell allows multiple generators to iterate over multiple lists
- You can generate combinations of elements from multiple lists

`pairs = [(x,y) | x <- [1..3], y <- [4..6]]`

### **Thunk**

A *thunk* is a deferred computation
Expression not yet evaluated
- But ready to be evaluated when needed

### **Memoization**

- Technique to cache results to function calls
- Avoid recomputation for same inputs
- Works best with pure functions
- Stores results in a table
- Saves time at cost of space
- Common in recursion & dynamic programming

Haskell doesn't do memoization by default!
