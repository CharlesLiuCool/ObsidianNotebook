Recall:

### **Four Pillars of Functional Programming**

- *Immutability*
- *Pure Functions*
- *Recursion*
- *Higher-Order Functions*

___

### **Pure Function Rules**

- Can't modify input object
- Can't change other objects (can't read/write to global variables)
- Can't change external resources
This means *no side effects*!


#### **Interesting Example** 
```cpp
Student increaseGPA(const Student& student) {
	Student newStudent = student;
	newStudent.gpa += 1.0
	return newStudent
}
```

Depends on how we implemented the copy constructor for `=`. When in doubt, impure (for Subu's test)

### **Exceptions in Pure Functions?**

- No, you can't!
- Also can't print, or read data from external source

### **Workaround?**

- Monads!

### **Currying**

You can just pass in one value into a Haskell function and it will create a partial function with that filled in that you can use!

This is called *currying* after Haskell Curry.
