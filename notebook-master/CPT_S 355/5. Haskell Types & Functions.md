### **Types**

What is a type? A type is a category of information with the same characteristics/attributes

How do types help?
1. Error Reduction (complains about mismatching types)
2. Reserve storage (e.g. int reserves 4 bytes)

### **Types Supported in Haskell**

- Inferred automatically by context
- Examples
	- `Int`
	- `Double`
	- `Char`
	- `Bool`

### **Typeclass**

A class which abstracts other types, e.g. `Integral` is a typeclass of `Int` and `Integer`.

**EQ Typeclass:** Anything that can be compared as equal to or not equal to `==`

### **Polymorphic Types**

We can restrict outputs/inputs of functions to a group of types by using typeclasses which encapsulate multiple types.

### **Functions**
```cpp
int add (int x, int y) {
	return x + y
}

//function invocation
add(1,2)
```

Calling a function is called *function invocation*

### **Higher Order Functions**
Functions which:
- take functions as arguments
- returns a function as a result 
- (or BOTH!)

Three most useful higher order functions

- Map
- Filter
- Fold

### **Properties of Functions**

*Arity*: the number of inputs a function takes, e.g. unity is a function with one input `a->b`
