### **Lexically Scoped**

It always takes from the namespace where the function is defined (if its not local)!

### **Dynamically Scoped**

It always takes from the namespace where the function is invoked (if its not local)!

```py
z = 0 # lexically takes this
def inc(x):
	x + z

def outer():
	z = 2 # dynamic takes this
	inc(x + z)
	
outer()
```
