### **Type Keyword**

`type` = typedef in C
Allows you to give a name to some tuple/group of types

### **User Defined Types**

Use keyword `newtype`
`newtype Age = Age Int`

the `Age` before `Int` is called a constructor, but it has nothing to do with C++ constructors... its a type constructor

Anytime we introduce our own types, we need to write overload for things like `show`

Instead of writing this, we can let Haskell do it for us

`newtype USD = USD Double deriving Show`

### **Constructor**

A *constructor* is a function that takes values and returns a new data type for that instance

### **Creating a Type that Groups Other Types**

Keyword derives new *algebraic data types* (ADT).


`data Shape = Rectangle Float Float | Square Float Float`

### **Recursive Data Types**

We can define recursive data types by using itself.
