A *programming paradigm* is a style, or "way," of programming

What can your computer do?
- Windows (Intel machine)
	- Intel Instruction Set (X86-64)
- Mac
	- Mac Instruction Set (ARM64)

**Imperative** -> **Structured** -> **Procedural** -> **Object-Oriented**

### **Imperative Programming**

- Writing programs in the form of imperative statements (aka commands)
- Imperative statement in English
	- "Go to a Bakery"
	- "Go touch Peter"
- *"default"* paradigm (like those we've seen in C/C++/Python)

### **Problems**

- Verbose
- More error prone
- Unnecessary/accidental redundancies
- Difficult to organize
	- hard to form mental model
	- difficult to debug
	- difficult to work in large teams

Solutions:
*Verbose* - invent programming languages, turn code into slightly more humanly-understandable format
*More error prone* - invent structured programming paradigms
*Unnecessary/accidental redundancies* - subroutines (now functions), invent procedural paradigm
*Difficult to organize* - unlucky

### **Structured Programming**

Introduce *code blocks* and get rid of harmful `goto`.

### **Procedural Programming**

Introduce *subroutines/functions* which help get rid of redundancies

The *C Language* is imperative, structured, procedural

### **What do we mean by code?**

We don't just mean functions/procedures, we also mean other things like in C, custom data types (structs)

### **How do we solve the problem of organization?**

Put similar code based on some commonality

### **Object-Oriented Programming**

A better way to organize code to improve readability for multiple collaborators and modularity.

Invented by Alan Kay, inspired by intracellular communication!

Objects have attributes and behaviors, and objects talk to each other.
But sometimes, they may have a lot of overlap! We can *class*ify them.

### **Functional Programming**

- Think about procedures as function maps
- lambda calculus
