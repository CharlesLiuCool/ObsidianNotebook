### **Instruction Execution**

- PC: Program Counter
	- Address of the current instruction being executed
- PC: Instruction memory, fetch instruction
- Register numbers: register file, read registers
- Depending on instruction class
	- Use ALU to calculate
		- Arithmetic result
		- Memory address for load/store
		- Branch target address
	- Access data memory for load/store
	- PC <- target address or PC + 4

### **Instruction Execution Phases**

- Instruction fetch
	- Bring the instruction from memory

### **RS, RT, RD Registers**
- RS and RT are source registers
- RD is a destination register

### **Instruction Decode Stage**

$$\text{R-type}\to \text{opcode | rs | rd | shift amount| funct}$$
$$\text{I-type} \to \text{opcode | rs | rd | immediate}$$
$$\text{Branch} \to \text{opcode | rs | rt | address}$$

- OPCODE is used to decode information from the instruction
