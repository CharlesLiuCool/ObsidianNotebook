### **Numbering Systems**

- Decimal (base 10)
- Binary (base 2)
- and more!

### **Decimals**

- Symbols:
$$0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$$
- Representing a number: sequence of symbols, e.g.
$$\underline{2}\,\underline{5}\,\underline{7}\,\underline{9}$$
- Each position is multiplied by $\text{(base)}^{\text{position number}}$
e.g.
$$212_{10} = 2 \times 10^2 + 1 \times 10^1 + 2 \times 10^0$$

### **Binary Number Systems**

- A computer has CPU's which are made of transistors
- A transistor is like a dam, once it opens it lets some water (current) through.

Transistor -> Binary -> Symbols $\{0,1\}$ -> Base $2$

### **Useful Terminology**

- *Least significant bit (LSB)*
	- The lowest order bit in a binary number
	- The rightmost digit
- *Most significant bit (MSB)*
	- The highest order bit in a binary number
	- The leftmost digit

If we have more resilient transistors, we obviously want to put them on the most significant bit side to prevent accidental bitflips as they would be more catastrophic.
