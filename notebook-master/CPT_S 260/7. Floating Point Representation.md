Converting numbers to floating point involves three steps
- Convert the integer part
- Convert the fraction part
- Join the two results with a radix point

For the fraction part, repeatedly multiply by $2$ and take whatever's left of the decimal point.

*Mantissa* is what the fractional part is called

### **Floating Point Representation**

To convert
$$(-1)^s \cdot (\text{Mantissa}) (2^{\text{Exp} + \text{bias}})$$

To get the number back
$$x = (-1)^s \times \underbrace{(1 + \text{fraction})}_\text{Significand} \times 2^{\text{Exponent} - \text{Bias}}$$

After we have the integer joined with the fraction converted, we need to normalize it.

$FP32$ has $1$ bit sign, $23$ bit normal part, $8$ bit fractional part
Bias for $FP32 = 127$

Exponent is the $2^k$ at the end
e.g.
$1.001 \times 2^0$, exponent is $0$
