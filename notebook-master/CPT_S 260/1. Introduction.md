## **Computer Architecture**

How are programs converted to assembly
Assembly is like the smaller instructions

Hardware/software interface

### **Programming Levels**

- High-level language
	- Level of abstraction closer to the problem domain
	- examples include C
- Assembly Language
	- textual representation of instructions
- Hardware representation
	- Binary digits (bits)
	- Encoded instructions as data

### **Smartphone Main Components**

- Microprocessor
- ROM
- RAM
- Digital Signal Processor
- Radio Module
- Microphone and Speaker
- Hardware Interfaces
- LCD Display

### **Smartphone Architecture**

- Smartphones store system data in electronically-erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM)
	- Service providers can reprogram phones without requiring physical access to memory chips
- Operating system is stored in the ROM (non-volatile memory)
- Most smartphones also include subscriber identity module (SIM) cards

### **Smartphone Microprocessors**

- Smartphones use embedded processors
	- Intel, ARM architectures dominate market
	- Examples include:
		- BlackBerry 8700, uses Intel PXA$901$ chip
		- iPhone uses Samsung ARM 1100 chip
