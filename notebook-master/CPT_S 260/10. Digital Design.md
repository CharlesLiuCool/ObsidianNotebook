### **Digital Systems**

- Takes a discrete information inputs and discrete internal information (system state) and generates a set of discrete outputs

### **Logic Design Basics**

- Information encoded in binary
	- Low voltage = 0, High voltage = 1
	- One wire per bit
	- Multi-bit data encoded on multi-wire buses
- Combinational element
	- Operate on data
	- Output on a function as input

### **Signal**

- An information variable represented by physical quantity
- For digital systems, the variable takes on discrete values
- Two level, or binary level are the most prevalent values in digital systems
- Binary values are represented abstractly
	- digits 0 and 1
	- words symbols False (F) and True(T)
	- words (symbols) Low (L) and High (H)
	- and words On and Off
- Binary values are represented by values or ranges of values of physical quantities

Analog is continuous, digital is discrete

### **Truth Tables**

- *Truth table* - a tabular listing of the values of a function for all possible combinations of values on its arguments

### **Basic Logic Gates**

- *NOT*, *AND*, and *OR* gates
- *NAND* and *NOR* gates
- Exclusive-or (*XOR*) gate

These are basic because they can't be broken down into simpler logic

### **Combinational Elements**

- *AND* Gate
- *Adder*
- *Multiplexer (Mux)*
- *Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)*

### **Types of Digital Systems**

- No state present
	- Combinational Logic System
	- Output = Function(Input)
- State present
	- State updated at discrete times
		- Synchronous Sequential System
	- State updated at any time
		- Asynchronous Sequential System
	- State = Function (State, Input)
	- Output = Function (State) or Function (State, Input)

### **Challenges of Purely Combinational Logic**

- Combinational digital logic changes output as soon as input changes
	- With the logic delay
- However this can cause jitter in the output data
- For example,
	- The output keeps changing while the operation is ongoing
	- When do we know the output is ready?
- Sequential logic with clocking addresses these issues
- At every positive clock edge or negative clock edge, we check for data
	- The combinational circuit should be fast enough the provide the output within the clock cycle

### **Registers**

- Register: a collection of binary storage elements
	- Multiple d flip-flops together
