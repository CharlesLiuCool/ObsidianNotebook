### **Abstraction Layers in Modern Systems**

- Application
- Algorithm
	- A set of methods to accomplish a certain task
	- Trying to optimize performance metrics(time + space + energy + fault tolerance)
- Programming Language
	- Tradeoff between readability and performance
- Operating System/Virtual Machine
	- Manages the hardware resources for a program to run
- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
	- Boundary between hardware and software

### **Five Components of the Computer**

1. Input
2. Output
3. Processor
	1. Control
	2. Data Path
4. Memory


Speed -> Registers > SRAM > DRAM > Secondary Storage
Memory -> Secondary Storage > DRAM > SRAM > Registers

*Speed:* The amount of data read/written in a period of time
*Latency:* The amount of time it takes for a piece of data to get from point $A$ to $B$

### **Words**

Word = 32-bit for MIPS

### **Converting to Assembly Language**

1. Bring the values from memory to the registers. Any time we do this, we use a `lw` function (stands for load word, word must be $32$-bits)
2. Save values into one of the eight saved registers we have, e.g. `lw` $s0, 0\text{x}00$
3. Perform operations, store in new temporary register
4. Save new value from temporary register into memory address using `sw`, e.g. `sw` $t3, 0\text{x}06$
5. Load the address `lw` $s0, 0\text{x}01$


### **Byte Addressable Memory**

*Byte addressable memory* Width of 8 bits, 8 memory depth
*2-Byte addressable memory* Width of 16 bits, 4 memory depth

Both are 64 bits, or *8 bytes*
