Use addition table
Convert to unsigned/signed format
(signed = two's complement)

### **Overflow**

- the addition of two numbers with the same sign or subtraction of two numbers with different sign may cause overflow
- The condition wherein a result cannot be represented in allocated memory
- An overflow condition can be detected by observing the carry into the sign bit and carry out of the sign bit
- A carry out of one after addition does not always result in overflow
- Check both carry in and out to detect overflow

If cin == cout, there is no overflow, if not equal, and cout = 1, there is overflow

### **Shifts**
- *Shift Right (>>)*
- *Shift Left (<<)*

Needed for multiplication!
