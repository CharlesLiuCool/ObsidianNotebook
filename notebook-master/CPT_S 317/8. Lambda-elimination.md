$\Lambda$-elimination ($\Lambda$-NFA to NFA)

$\Lambda$-NFA = NFA + $\Lambda$-transitions

>Suppose you are trying to make the state diagram of
>$$(0+11)^* (1 + 00)^*$$

**$\Lambda$-Nondeterministic Finite Automatas ($\Lambda$-NFA)** are natural

But how do I reduce it to **NFA**?

Consider where you can go from each state with inputs $0$, $1$ factoring in $\Lambda$.
