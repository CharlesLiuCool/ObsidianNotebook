All rules are in the form of $A \to BC$ (one no-terminal to two no-terminals) or $A \to a$ (one terminal to one terminal).

### **Convert to CNF**
1. Eliminate $\Lambda$-production rules
$A \to \Lambda$
2. Eliminate unit-production rules
3. Write the CNF

### **Pushdown Automata (PDA)**

Intuitively, PDA = FA + a pushdown stack.

### **Math Definition of PDF**

A PDA $M$ is a tuple
$$\langle Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, z_0, A \rangle$$
where 
- $Q$ is a finite set of states,
- $\Sigma$ is an input alphabet,
- $\Gamma$ is a stack alphabet, 
- $z_0 \in \Gamma$ is the stack bottom symbol,
- $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state $A \subseteq Q$ are the accepting states.

___

### **State Transitions**

$\delta: Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\Lambda\}) \times \Gamma \to 2^{Q \times \Gamma^*}$

Examples:
$$\delta(q,a,b) = \{(p,ab)\}$$

This instruction is going to the PDA move if current state if the PDA $q$, and we are reading input symbol $a$ and the top of the stack of $b$, then the next state is $p$, and we just push $a$ (top of stack becomes $ab$).


___

### **Final Exam**

$$L = \{a^{2n}b^{3m}: n,m \ge 1\}$$
