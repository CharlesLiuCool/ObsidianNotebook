>**Definition** (Context-Free Grammar)
>A context-free grammar $G$ is defined as 
>$$\langle V, \Sigma, S, P \rangle$$
>where
>$V:$ non-terminal symbols;
>$\Sigma$: terminal symbols;
>$V \cap \Sigma = \emptyset$
>$S \in V$ is the start symbol;
>$P$ (production rules), each rule is in the form

We write $\alpha \implies_G^* \beta$ if there are $n \ge 1$ and $\beta_0, ..., \beta_n$ in $(V\cup\Sigma)^*$ s.t.
1. $\beta_0 = \alpha$
2. $\beta_n = \beta$
3. $\beta_i \implies_G \beta_{i+1}$ for each $i = 0,1,...,n-1$ where (one-step) derivation

$\alpha \implies_G \beta$ if there is a rule $A \to \gamma$ in $P$ such that
$\alpha = \alpha_1A \alpha_2$
$\beta=\alpha_1\gamma\alpha_2$

The language generated by the grammar $G$ is defined as $L(G) = \begin{cases}w \in \Sigma^*: S \implies_G^* w \end{cases}$
