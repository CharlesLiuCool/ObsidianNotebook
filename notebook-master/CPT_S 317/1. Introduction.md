## **Automata and Formal Languages**

509-338-5089

Automata = anything that is moving or not moving

Formal = mathematical/precise definition
Languages = a set of strings

entire computer science study relations between cats and sacks of strings lol

A string = a sequence of events = behavior

Turing test = testing the behavior of an algorithm to see if its indistuinguishable from natural intelligence

Elevator | Elevator's behavior
behavior = requirements
elevator = program

Consider a language $L$ where all strings are in the format
$$a,...,a,b$$
where there are $0$ or more $a$'s

*Note:* By convention, a program's observable behavior is one when it exists nicely.
