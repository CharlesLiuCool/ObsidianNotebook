>**Theorem** (Cartesian Product Construction)
>Let $M_1$, $M_2$ be two DFA's. Then we can construct a DFA $M$ such that
>$$L(M) = L(M_1) \cap L(M_2)$$


*Proof:*
Create finite automata with $M_1$ and $M_2$ as subautomata.

**Example**
Take
![[6. Cartesian Product 2025-09-08 15.25.11.excalidraw|900]]

Construct $M_1 \cap M_2$, and we get $L(M) = (0110)^*$
