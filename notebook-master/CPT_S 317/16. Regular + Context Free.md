Given a PDA $M$, a FA $M'$,
There is an algorithm to solve the problem.
$L(M) \cap L(M') = \emptyset$

Prove:
Let $M$ be A FA. There is an algorithm to solve whether there is a word $w$ such that $w \in L(M)$ and $\#_a(w) = \#_b(w)$

Understand that the two languages intersect to be context free, which can be written as a PDA, and there is an algorithm for emptiness.
