 For given state, there could be multiple states.

### **Non-determinism**

Two understandings:
1. Elevator in perspective of person
2. When we describe a nondeterministic decider


Formally, an NFA $M$ is the same as DFA except for the $\delta$ (transitions):
$$\delta: \Sigma \times Q \to 2^{Q}$$

$2^{Q}$ is the powerset of $Q$


Let $M$ be an NFA. We say that $M$ accepts $w$ if $w = a_0a_1...a_k$ and there are states $q_1,...,q_{k+1}$ of
$$q_0\overset{a_0}\to q_1 \overset{a_1}\to ... \overset{a_k}\to q_{k+1}$$

We never say "$M$ rejects $w$" or "$M$ says no on $w$" for NFA

We always $M$ accepts $w$, $M$ does not accept $w$.

>**Theorem** Subset Construction
>There is an algorithm called subset construction to convert NFA to DFA (i.e., they accept the same language).

Turn every subset into a state
