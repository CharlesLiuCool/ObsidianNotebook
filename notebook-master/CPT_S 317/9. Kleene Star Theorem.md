$\lambda$-NFA => NFA ($\lambda$ elimination)
NFA => DFA (subset construction)

Given regular language, draw an automata

Automata to language construction
Let $M$ be a finite automata. One can construct a regular expression for (the language accepted by the automata)
$L(M)$

Without loss of generality, we can number the states in $M$ with
$$1,2,3,...,n$$
$1$ is initial state
$n$ is accepting state

I define $R_{ij}^k =$ the set of all words on a walk in $M$ from $i$ to $j$ where in between (excluding $i$ and $j$, two ends) there is no node greater than $k$.

All words on walks for initial (state $1$) to accepting (state $n$) such that in between, there is no node greater than $n$
$R_{in}^n = L(M)$

We just need to find an algorithm to compute $R_{1n}^n$
