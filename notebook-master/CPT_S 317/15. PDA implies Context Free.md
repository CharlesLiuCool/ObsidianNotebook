1) We do have languages that are context free but not regular.
(Recall: $\{a^nb^n: n \ge 1\}$ is not regular)

2) Today: how to prove a language is not context free.


>**Theorem.** (Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Grammar)
>
>Let $L$ be an infinite context free language. Then, there is a number $n$ such that for each word $z \in L$ with $|z| \ge n$, $z$ can be written into $5$ parts. For some $u,v,w,x,y$ where
$$z = uvwxy$$
>such that 
>1. $|vwx| \le n$
>2. $|vx| \ge 1$
>3. $\forall\;i,\;uv^iwx^iy \in L$

Show $L = \{a^nb^nc^n: n \ge 0\}$ is not context free.

*Proof:*
Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Grammar
Assume $L$ is a context free grammar. Let $n$ be the number in the pumping lemma. 

Pick a long word $z = a^nb^nc^n$ with $|z| = 3n \ge n$ in $L$. ($z$ has to depend on $n$!). For each possible way to write $z$ into $uvwxy$, such that
1. $|vwx| \le n$
2. $|vx| \ge 1$
3. $\forall\;i,\;uv^iwx^iy \in L$

The middle, $vwx$, can contain at most $2$ kinds of symbols.

Therefore, since $|vx| \ge 1$, we take $i = 2$
$uvvwxxyy \notin L$ since there are three symbol counts are off-balanced.
