- A hypothesis test is a formal procedure for comparing observed data with a hypothesis whose truth we want to assess
- The hypothesis is a statement about the parameters $\mu$ in a population or model.
- The results of a test are expressed in terms of a probability that measures how well the data and hypothesis agree.

### **Null and Alternative Hypotheses**

- *Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)* is the claim that is initially assumed to be true.
- *Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$)* is the assertion that is contradictory to H$0$.

Default is null hypothesis. 

>*Key Point*
>We either reject H$0$ or fail to reject H$0$.

___

### **Example 1**

A health organization claims that at least $30\%$ of adults skip breakfast.
You believe that true proportion is lower than what they claim.

>$H_0$: At least $30\%$ of adults skip breakfast
>$H_A$: Less than $30\%$ of adults skip breakfast.

Let $p$ be the true proportion, we normally write

>$H_0$: $p = 30\%$
>$H_A$: $p < 30\%$

___

### **Example 2**
A cereal manufacturer advertises that each box contains $500$ grams of cereal on average.

You suspect the boxes contains less than advertised.

Let $\mu$ be the true mean of grams of cereal.

>$H_0$: $\mu = 500$
>$H_A$: $\mu < 500$

___

### **Test Statistics**

We use *test statistics* to summarize what a sample mean tells us about the validity of the true mean.

___

### **The Rejection Region**

- The *rejection region* is the set of all test-statistic values for which $H_0$ will be rejected.
___

### **One-Sample t-test**

Test Statistic
$$t = \dfrac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$

Alternative Hypothesis
- $H_A : \mu > \mu_0$
- $H_A: \mu < \mu_0$
- $H_A: \mu \neq \mu_0$

Rejection Region:
- $t \ge t_{\sigma,n-1}$
- $t \le t_{\sigma,n-1}$
- $t \ge t_{\sigma,n-1}$ or $t \le -t_{\sigma,n-1}$

___

### **p-values**

The *p-value* is computed by assuming that the null hypothesis is true, and then asking how likely we would be to observe a test statistic as supportive or more supportive of the alternative under that assumption.
