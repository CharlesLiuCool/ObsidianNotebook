### **Statistics**

A *statistic* is any quantity whose value can be calculated from sample data, e.g. sample mean, sample median, sample variance, etc.

A statistic can be thought of as a random variable because it is computed from the random sample

### **Sampling Distribution**

Any statistic, being a random variable, has a probability distribution.

The probability distribution of a statistic is sometimes referred to as its *sampling distribution*

### **Random Samples**

The probability distribution of any particular statistic depends not only on the population distribution (normal, uniform, etc.) and the sample size $n$ but also on the method of sampling

For *simple random samples*, each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance, such that each individual has the same probability of being chosen.

### **Random Statistics**

Many researchers are interested in the yearly income of Washington State residents.

Researcher A collected $100$ samples and computed the sample average income of $56,000$.

Researcher B independently collected $100$ samples and computed the sample average annual income of $\$48,000$

Researcher C,D,E,F...

### **The "Meta-Experiment"**

- The *"Meta-Experiment"* consists of indefinitely many repetitions of the same experiment
- If the experiment is taking a sample of $100$ items from a population, the meta-experiment is to repeatedly take samples of $100$ items from the population
- This is a theoretical construct to help us understand the probabilities involved in our experiment.

### **Distribution of the Sample Mean**

Let $X_1, X_2,...,X_n$ be a random sample from a distribution with mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

Then
1. $E(\bar{X}) = \mu$
2. $V(\bar{X}) = \sigma^2 / n$
3. $SD(\bar{X}) = \sigma/\sqrt{n}$

### **Normal Distributions**

Let $X_1, X_2,...,X_n$ be a random sample from a normal distribution with mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

Then for any $n$, $\bar{X}$ is *normally* distributed (with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$)

### **The Central Limit Theorem**

Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ be a random sample from any distribution with mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

Then if $n$ is sufficiently large, $\bar{X}$ has approximately a normal distribution with
$$E(\bar{X}) = \mu \text{ and } V(\bar{X}) = \sigma^2 / n$$

The general rule of thumb is $n=30$ to get close to normal, $n=40$ if the population distribution is really skewed.
