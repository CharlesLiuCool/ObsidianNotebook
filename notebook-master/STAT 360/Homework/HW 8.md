### **Question 1.**
A researcher wants to compare the average exam scores of students who attended an optional review session and those who did not. A set of students are randomly selected from each group. The summarized data are as follows:  

| Group        | $n$ | Mean | SD  |
| ------------ | --- | ---- | --- |
| attended     | $12$  | $84.5$ | $5.2$ |
| not attended | $10$  | $79.3$ | $6.1$ |

*A.* Is this a paired study or two-independent sample? 

This is a $\boxed{\text{two-independent sample study}}$. The two groups of attended/not attended use different students, which means one student's score in the "attended" section doesn't correspond to another in "not attended".

*B.* Construct a $90\%$ confidence interval for the difference between mean score for the two groups of students. Does the data provide evidence to indicate a difference?  


*C.* Explain the conditions for using $t$-methods.  

*D.* Regardless of your answer in B, run a t-test to investigate if students who attended the review session have higher average score than those who did not. Use significance level α=0.05. Provide each of the four steps: 1. State the null and alternative hypotheses. 2. Calculate the test statistic, 3. Find p-value and 4. Make the conclusion.  

### **Queston 2**

A veterinarian wants to whether a new daily electrolyte supplement lowers  
resting heart rate. Eight adult horses at a single stable were enrolled. Each horse served as its own control. After a 7-day wash-in with no supplement, resting heart rate (beats per minute, bpm) was measured in the morning after 10 minutes of stall rest. The supplement was then administered once daily for 14 days. On day 14, the resting heart rate was re-measured at the same time of day, using the same heart rate monitor and technician. The data are given below.  

| Horse       | Before | After  | Difference |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| 1           | 42     | 40     | -2         |
| 2           | 39     | 37     | -2         |
| 3           | 44     | 42     | -2         |
| 4           | 41     | 40     | -1         |
| 5           | 45     | 44     | -1         |
| 6           | 43     | 42     | -1         |
| 7           | 40     | 38     | -2         |
| 8           | 42     | 40     | -2         |
| Sample mean | 42     | 40.375 | -1.625     |
| Sample SD   | 2      | 2.264  | 0.518      |

A. Is this a paired study or two-independent sample?  
B. Run a t-test to investigate whether daily electrolyte supplement lowers resting  
heart rate. Use significance level α=0.05. Provide each of the four steps: 1. State  
the null and alternative hypotheses. 2. Calculate the test statistic, 3. Find p-value  
and 4. Make the conclusion.  
Question 3. One study reports the results of a survey of 495 elementary school teachers  
and 375 high school teachers. Of the elementary school teachers, 344 said they were very  
satisfied with their jobs, whereas 226 of the high school teachers were very satisfied with  
their work. We are interested to know the difference between the proportion of all  
elementary school teachers who are very satisfied and all high school teachers who are  
very satisfied. Do teachers find their work rewarding and satisfying?  
A. Construct a 95% confidence interval for difference between the proportion of  
elementary school teachers who are very satisfied and of high school teachers.  
Based on this confidence interval can you conclude that there is a difference  
between the proportions?  
B. Run a (two-sided) hypothesis test with α=0.05. Give the test statistic, p-value and  
conclusion.|
