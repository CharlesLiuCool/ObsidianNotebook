*Statistics* covers the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data.

The *population* is the entire collection of the units which we are interested.

A *sample* is a collection of persons/things on which we measure one ore more variables

The number of observations in a sample is called the *sample size* and is denoted by the letter *n*

Sample = population => *Census*

*Target Population* is the population you are interested in

*Sampled Population* is the population you actually do sample

*Warning:* You make the inference only on the sampled population

A *simple random sample* is a sample where all members of the population have an equal chance of selection and the selection of one member is independent of the selection of another.

Random sampling allows us to make inference back to a population.

As McAleer would say, a small spoon of soup in a well-mixed bowl is enough to tell if the soup is good or not (usually).

*Variable* is information of interest about each individual item in a population

*Categorical/Qualitative Variables* are those we can place into categories
 - *Ordinal* variables with inherent order (e.g. small medium large)
 - *Non-ordinal* variables without inherent order (e.g. apple orange banana
 
*Numerical/Quantitative Variables* are those we can record numerically
- *Discrete Variables* have values that can be obtained by counting
- *Continuous Variables* can take any value within a given interval

*Population parameter:* a numerical value describing a property of a population such as mean, median, and variance.

*Sample Statistics:* also referred to as simply "statistics" are numeric values describing or summarizing a data set. Also referred to as estimators because one purpose is to estimate population parameters.

*Inferential Statistics* is the group of techniques for generalizing from a sample to a population
