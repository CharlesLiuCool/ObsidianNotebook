### **Probability**

The language of randomness and uncertainty

### **Sample Space and Events**

An *experiment* is an action or process whose outcome is random.

The *sample space* of an experiment (denoted $S$) is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment.

An *event* is any collection (or subset) of outcomes contained in the sample space $S$

The *complement* of an event $A$ (denoted $A'$) is the set of all outcomes in $S$ that are not contained in $A$

The *union* of two events $A$ and $B$ (denoted $A \cup B$ and read "$A$ or $B$") is the event consisting of all outcomes that are either in $A$ or $B$ or in both events.

The *intersection* of two events $A$ and $B$ (denoted $A \cap B$ and read "$A$ and $B$") is the event consisting of all outcomes that are both in $A$ and $B$. 

$\emptyset$ (emptyset) denotes the null event (the event consisting of no outcomes whatsoever).

When $A \cap B = \emptyset$, $A$ and $B$ are said to be *mutually exclusive*
 or *disjoint* events.

### **Conditional Probability**

- We use notation $\Pr(A|B)$ to represent the probability of $A$ given that $B$ has occurred
- $\Pr(A)$ is the unconditional probability of $A$
