### **Probability Axioms**

1. For any event $A$, $0 \le \Pr(A) \le 1$
2. $\Pr(S)=1$
3. If $A_1,A_2,A_3,...,A_n$ be the set of *mutually exclusive* events, then
$$\Pr(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup ... \cup A_n) = \sigma_{i=1}^n \Pr(A_i)$$
4. 
   $\Pr(A) + \Pr(A') = 1$
$\Pr(A) = 1 - Pr(A')$
5. $\Pr(\emptyset) = 0$
6. $\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A \cap B)$

### **Law of Total Probability**

- Recall that $A_1, A_2,...,A_k$ are mutually exclusive if no two have any common outcomes
- If $A_1,A_2,...,A_k$ are said to be exhaustive if $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ...\cup A_k = S$
- Let $A_1, A_2, ..., A_k$ be mutually exclusive and exhaustive then for any event
$$\Pr(B) = \Pr(B|A_1)\Pr(A_1) + ... + \Pr(B|A_k)\Pr(A_k) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \Pr(B|A_i)\Pr(A_i)$$
$$=\Pr(B \cap A_1) + \Pr(B \cap A_2) + ... + \Pr(B \cap A_k)$$

### **Bayes' Theorem**

Let $A_1,A_2,...,A_k$ be *mutually exclusive* and *exhaustive events* with prior probabilities $Pr(A_i), i\in 1,...,k$. Then for any event $B$ for which $Pr(B) > 0$. The "posterior" probability of $A$ given that $B$ has occurred is

$$P(A_j | B) = \frac{P(A_j \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A_j)P(A_j)}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^kP(B|A_j)P(A_j)}$$


### **Probability Trees**

- A probability tree maps out the sequence of events to help calculate the likelihood of complex outcomes.
- Each branch represents a different outcome route that could happen

### **Independence**

- Two events $A$ and $B$ are *independent* if $\Pr(A|B) = \Pr(A)$ and are *dependent* otherwise.
- $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if
$$\Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B)$$
