The *mean* is simply the average. To find the mean, we add up (sum) all the values and divide by the number of values:
$\bar{x} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\dfrac{x_i}{n}$

The *sample mean* is the mean of a subset of sampled data.

The *median* is the value that most nearly lies in the middle of the sample.

From a list of *ordered* observations, the median is the middle value (if n is odd) or the average of the middle two values (if n is even)

An *outlier* affects the *mean* more compared to the *median*

The *trimmed mean* is a compromise between the mean and the median.

A *10%-trimmed mean* is calculated by eliminating the smallest and largest 10% and then taking the average of what's left.

It's like an in-between of mean and median.

### **Measures of Spread**

Two simple measures of spread are
- *Range* = Max - Min
- *Interquartile Range (IQR)* = Q3 - Q1

The *sample variance* is computed as:
$$s^2 = \dfrac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1} = \dfrac{S_{xx}}{n-1}$$

The *sample standard deviation* is computed as
$$s=\sqrt{s^2}$$

### **Types of Charts**

*Pie charts* are useful when only one categorial variables is observed.

*Bar charts* also show percentages of frequencies in various categories, but they can be used to represent multiple categorical variables simultaneously.

A *skewed* data set is one that is basically unimodal but is substantially off from being bell-shaped.

![[2. 2025-08-21 15.46.24.excalidraw|500]]

The figure above is also a *smoothed* histogram, where curves are superimposed on the rectangles that illustrate the various possibilities.

The number of peaks can also be represented with terminology.
1. Unimodal
2. Bimodal
3. Trimodal
