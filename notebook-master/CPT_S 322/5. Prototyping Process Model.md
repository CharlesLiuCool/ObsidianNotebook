### **Prototyping Process Model**

- Emphasizes the creation of a working model of the system, called a *prototype*
- Allows stakeholders to visualize the system early in the development process, providing valuable feedback and helping refine requirements before final product is built

### **Advantages**

- Enhanced User Involvement
- Early Issue Detection
- Improved Communication
- Flexibility

### **Disadvantages**

- "Throwing away" the prototype(s), too resource/time intensive
- Misleading prototypes which don't represent the final project well
- Delay project which can lead to *scope creep*, delaying projects and increasing costs

### **Spiral Model**

- Instead of throwing away the prototype, keep evolutionarily iterating over projects to create new and better versions
