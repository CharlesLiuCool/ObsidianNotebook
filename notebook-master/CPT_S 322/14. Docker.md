### **Why Docker?**

- "It works on my machine" problem
- Complex dependencies
- We need a "shipping container!"
- Standardized, Portable, Reliable

### **Docker Image**

- App + all dependencies
- Configs & Scripts
- Binaries & Libraries
- Metadata (env variables, default commands)

### **Docker Containers**

- Running instance of image
- Isolated, lightweight, portable
- Shares host OS Kernel
- Has its own
	- Filesystem
	- Processes
	- Network

### **Pros**

- Isolation
- Efficiency

- *Dependency Layer:* Packages, libraries, language, etc.
- *App Layer:* Your actual code for the app

### **YAML**

- *YAML* stands for "YAML ain't markup language" (originally "Yet another markup language")
