### **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**

- A *UML Diagram*  is a standardized way to visualize the design of a system
- Used in software engineering to model, document, and represent the structure and behavior of software systems
- Provides graphical notation for specifying, constructing, and documenting software systems

### **UML Diagram Categories**

- *Structural Diagrams*: These represent the static aspects of a system, such as the architecture, components, and relationships
- *Behavioral Diagrams*: These represent the dynamic aspects of a system, such as the interactions, processes, and behaviors of system components.



>- *Class Diagram*: Structural
>- *Sequence Diagram*: Behavioral
>- *State Machine Diagram*: Behavioral
>- *Use Case Diagram*: Behavioral
>- *Deployment Diagram*: Structural

### **What is UML?**

- Visualizing
- Specifying
- Constructing
- Documenting


### **Use-Case Diagram**

- A use case diagram is a visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and a system, showcasing the various use cases and how they connect to each other
- It provides a high level of the system's functionality and is a valuable tool in the requirement gathering and analysis phases of software development

### **Four Elements of Use Case Diagram**

- System
- Actors
	- Primary Actors: directly interacting with the system
	- Secondary Actors: indirectly interacting with the system, supporting the system but not initiating use cases
- Use-case
	- Specified functionality
- Relationship
	- Association: connects actor to use case, showing the actor is involved there. It is represented with a solid line
	- Include: represents a use case that is *always* called or included by another use case. Represented by a dashed arrow with the label `<<include>>`pointing to the included use case.
	- Extend: represents *optional* or conditional functionality that extends the behavior of a use case. Represented by a dashed arrow with the label `<<exclude>>`.
