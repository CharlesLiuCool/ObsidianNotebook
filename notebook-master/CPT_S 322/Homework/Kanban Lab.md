### **Reflection**

The Kanban setup process was a little weird, especially the part linking the project planning and giving teammates access. The later processes like template setup, user stories, issue creation, etc. were pretty intuitive and we can definitely see as helpful in the future. I like that the template allows a starting base for user stories everytime, and is customizable in Markdown which I'm really familiar with. Our team sees this as a clearer way to organize who's doing what and setting requirements. We also see that it allows us to follow the Kanban process of focusing on a few tasks and closing them out before starting the next, focusing on production.
