### **Part 1: Concept Summaries**

#### *Kanban Summary*

- *Board*
The Kanban Board is a visual board that helps show a team's workflow. Translated in Japanese, where it means "signboard", it shows each person's work in real time for progress tracking
- *Cards*
These represent each task/work item and offer details/descriptions. This may include estimates, context, assignee, and more. They can move across columns as work is made and the workflow progresses.
- *Columns*
Columns represent steps in the workflow, dividing up the Kanban board. Examples include `To do`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, and `Completed`. Cards move across these column categories as work progresses.
- *Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits*
In order to focus on work completed and prevent bottlenecking, multitasking, etc., every stage has a max limit for tasks allowed at once. This shouldn't be too high, so teams ensure they finish tasks before working on new ones instead of having a bunch open at once.
- *Benefits*
Kanban boards offer clear organization of workflows and allow smooth collaboration, using cards to show who's doing what. They also help prevent overload and bottlenecking, ensure tasks get closed out before new ones start.

#### *SRS*

- *Business Requirements*
Business requirements explain why the system is being developed and what value it brings at a high level
- *User Requirements*
User requirements capture the needs and expectations of users. These can be captured through scenarios and user stories.
- *Functional Requirements*
Functional requirements specify the behavior a system has to follow. They are specific features that must be implemented
- *Non-Functional Requirements*
Non-functional requirements address attributes and constraints, helping consider performance, scalability, security, and usability.
- *Why Clarity and Traceability Matter*
Clarity helps get rid of confusion and ambiguity, making sure everyone from stakeholders to developers understand the requirements the same, helping reduce costly trouble
Traceability ensures each requirement is tied back to its goal, helping link up value to requirement while allowing prioritization and validation.

### **Part 2: Reflection**

1. Which concept from either resource was most surprising or valuable to you? Why?

I feel like the work-in-progress limits in Kanban was really interesting to me. At my workplace, we have Kanban boards, and I never really understand why we had such urgency to "close out" items before working on new ones, but now it makes sense: it's to help prevent bottlenecking and focus on work completed.

2. How could you apply one of these concepts to your current or future project work?

I recently applied a Kanban Board to my homework workflow, improving task visualization while making sure I don't have a ton of homework in progress, and I totally complete assignments before starting new ones. I also copied the "review" column, which I really like. This column ensures I peer review relevant projects/assignments for accuracy.

3. What new insights did you gain from these resources that were not covered in class?

I feel like the traceability in SRS documentation was really interesting. During class, we talked about the different types of requirements and how to gather them. The blog added onto this understanding however, explaining how we can map business requirements to user, functional, and non-functional requirements makes sure the motivations aren't lost at development. This also allows easy prioritization of tasks, as both developers and stakeholders understand the "why" behind them.

### **Part 3: Application**

The WIP limits helps my homework Kanban board as it ensures I focus on a finish out homework assignments before starting new ones, so I don't get overwhelmed and I can handle the workload task by task.
