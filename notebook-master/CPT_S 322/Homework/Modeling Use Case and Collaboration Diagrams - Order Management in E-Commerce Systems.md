### **Short Reflection**

1. Which object or interaction in your collaboration diagram was the hardest to model and why?

The order processing was the hardest to model since it was so involved and there are so many aspects. It interacts with a bunch of different objects like the cart, the inventory manager, and the notification service.

2. What trade-offs did you consider when deciding where to place certain logic or data flow?

I had to consider what is an important interaction and what is less important. Each object has a bunch of interactions with each other but displaying all of them would cause massive clutter when some of them are less important and unnecessary for display. I also had to consider where to place each object to not cause a mess, factoring in where arrows would be for object interactions.
