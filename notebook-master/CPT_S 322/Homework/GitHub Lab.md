### **Reflection**

In this lab, I gained hands-on experience with how GitHub workflows work through practicing many commands and common practices. I learned how to manage and create new repositories which contain code. I also worked on making branches independent of the main code and then committing/merging/creating pull reviews once done. I practiced forking which lets me edit other people's code in my own copy. Through this, I recognized the power of GitHub, specifically its ease for collaboration with multiple people across different parts of the world.
