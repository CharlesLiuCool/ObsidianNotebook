### **Part 1: Project Scenario**

Your team has been asked to estimate the cost of building a Student Portal System for a university.  
The system includes:

- Student login
- Course enrollment
- Grades & transcripts
- Notifications
- Integration with existing databases

You must determine what factors will influence the total software cost.

___

### **Part 2: Identify Cost Factors**

List all factors that affect the cost of developing this software.  
Use the categories below as guidance.

- People & Skills

- Time

- Complexity

- Quality & Testing

- Resources & Tools

- Maintenance

Add more if needed:

___

### **Part 3: Rank the Cost Drivers**

|**Category**|**Rank (1–6)**|**Why did you choose this rank?**|
|---|---|---|
|People & Skills|1|The people drive the project, having a good team helps streamline all the others.|
|Time|2| The longer a project takes the more costly all the others will be.|
|Complexity|6| Only expensive because can amplify other drivers.|
|Quality & Testing|5|Quality and testing are important, but can be slightly overlooked for prototype phases of the project. |
|Resources & Tools|4|The tools required to jumpstart and build the project are pretty important.|
|Maintenance|3| Long term, maintenance costs a bunch of money|

### **Part 4:  Create a Cost Formula**

Suppose each driver is rated from $0$ to $1$. Our team's formula is:
$$\begin{align} 6 \times (\text{People and Skills}) &+ 5 \times (\text{Time}) + 4 \times (\text{Maintenance}) + 3 \times (\text{Resources and Tools}) \\ &+ 2 \times (\text{Quality and Testing}) + 1 \times (\text{Complexity})\end{align}$$

### **Part 5: Final Reflection**

1. Why is LOC alone not a reliable measure of software cost?
LOC only measures quantity of code, not complexity, quality, or effort. Two same LOC programs can be very different in difficulty, quality, and required knowledge. Modern development can significantly reduce lines of code also. LOC doesn't capture design, testing, and maintenance costs also.
2. Which cost factor surprised your group the most? Why?
Maintenance was a very surprising factor. We realized that thsi may be very important, but we didn't realize it was such a high expense task. Fixing bugs, updating systems, and adapting technologies really adds up.
