### **COCOMO**



1. *Basic COCOMO*: Provides a general estimate based on project type and size
2. *Intermediate COCOMO*: Adds cost drivers
3. *Detailed COCOMO*: Adds more parameters and considerations


### **Project Types in COCOMO**

1. Organic - Basic
2. Semi-Detached Projects - Medium
3. Embedded Projects - High

### **Formula**

$$\text{Effort}(\text{Person-Months}) = a \times (\text{Size in KLOC})^b$$
$$\text{Development Time}(\text{Months}) = c \times (\text{Effort})^d$$
where $a,b,c,d$ are constraints specific to each project type

- Person-Months: The amount of work a person can complete in one month
- KLOC: "Thousands Lines of Code" or the estimate size of the project

### **Constants**

The constants are derived from empircal data from previous software projects.

### **Intermediate COCOMO**

Expands on Basic COCOMO by introducing *cost drivers*
Cost drivers are factors that influence the effort and duration of a project, including team experience, software reliability requirements, and hardware constraints.

$$\text{Effort}(\text{Person-Months}) = a \times (\text{Size in KLOC})^b \times \prod(\text{Cost Driver Values})$$

### **Detailed COCOMO**

It breaks down the project into multiple phases of the software development lifecycle, such as requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.

*Phase Specific Effort Estimates*:
- Requirements Analysis
- System Design
- Detailed Design
- Coding and Testing
- Integration and Testing
- etc.

### **Agile-Based Estimation**
*Story points* is a technique that measures complexity, effort, and risk associated with a task or user story. This can gauge how challenging a task is relative to the rest.

*Velocity* is the average number of story points the team completes per sprint.
