### **Software Process Steps**

In general, the steps of a software process include:

1. Communicating
2. Planning
3. Modeling
4. Construction
5. Deployment

### **Waterfall Model**

The waterfall model is doing the software process in the exact order
1. Communicating
2. Planning
3. Modeling
4. Construction
5. Deployment

rigidly, finishing one and going to the next.

>Why is it called the *waterfall model*? Once water starts falling, you can't go back without costly efforts.

The process is sequential and linear.

*Pros:*
- Simple/Intuitive
- Clear cut stages and milestones
- Easy to manage
- Suitable for stable requirements

*Cons*:
- Poor feedback loops
- Poor flexibility
- Bad engagement with client for complicated projects
- No working software until end
- Not suitable for complex projects

Note that this is not great for a big, complex project. Although suitable for something like a hackathon, this is a starting point from which we want to improve.

### **Flow of Software Processes**

Possible direction of flows
- Linear (Waterfall Model)

- Iterative (can go back and repeat and refine)

- Evolutionary (circular)

- Parallel (do some activities in parallel)
