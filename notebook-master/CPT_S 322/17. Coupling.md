### **Data Coupling (best)**

Modules share data through parameters, minimal dependency.

### **Stamp Coupling**

Instead of just passing data, atomic values, you are passing the full structure. (Also called *structure coupling*)

### **Control Coupling**

Happens when one module controls the behavior of another by passing information that influences the logic of the latter.

### **Common Coupling**

Any changes in data (which is global) can cause side effects everywhere

### **Content Coupling (worst)**

Happens when one module directly accesses or modifies the internal data or code of another module.
