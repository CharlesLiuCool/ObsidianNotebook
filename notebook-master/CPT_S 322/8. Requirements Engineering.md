>Requirement engineering is a critical phase in the software development life cycle. It lays the foundation for any successful project by capturing, analyzing and defining the needs of a certain software project

### **Traditional ways of Requirement Engineering**

- Interviews
- Surveys
- Meetings
- etc.

### **User Stories**

- *User stories* are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality told from the perspective of an end user
- They capture what a user needs and why without diving into the technical details or implementation specifics
- Typically user stories are written in plain language to ensure stakeholders, regardless of technical expertise, can understand

### **Key Components of a User Story**

1. **Title:** A short description of the story
2. **As a \[user role]:** *Who* is the story about? This could be an end-user, administrator, etc.
3. **I want \[goal]:** *What* does the user want to achieve?
4. **So that [reason]:** *Why* does the user want to achieve this goal?

### **Scenarios**

- While user stories capture the "what" and "why" of a feature, scenarios dive deeper into the "how"
- It builds a narrative of how the user interacts with the system to achieve a goal
- It covers various paths and conditions that can occur while using the system
- It helps validate the completeness of user stories by detailing the interactions with the workflows

### **Gherkin Syntax**

- *Gherkin* is a domain-specific language used to define test cases in a natural language format
- It is commonly used in *Behavior Driven Development (BDD)*

>- Given Preconditions
>- When Action
>- Expect Postconditions

### **Importance of User Stories**

- Provide Context
- Identify Edge Cases
- Improve Communication
- Facilitate Testing
- Enhance User Experience
