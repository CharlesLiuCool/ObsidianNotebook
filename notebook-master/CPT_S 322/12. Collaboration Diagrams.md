### **Communication Diagram**

A communication diagram, also known as a collaboration diagram, is a type of interaction diagram in UML that illustrates the interactions between objects or parts in terms of sequences of messages

It provides a dynamic view of the system and how objects collaborate to achieve a specific behavior or outcome.

### **Key Characteristics**

*Objects and Roles:*
- Objects: represent the entities or instances that participate in the interaction. Each object is shown as rectangle, and the name of the object is typically written inside it
- Roles: Define the function that an object plays in the interaction

*Links:*
- Represent the connections between objects that are used to pass messages. These are depicted as lines connecting the objects.

*Messages:*
- Indicate the communication between objects. Messages are shown as labeled arrows pointing from the sender object to the receiver object. The labels include the message sequence number to indicate the order of execution.

*Sequence Numbers:*
- Ensure that the messages are executed in the correct order. These are typically prefixed numbers like $1,1.1,1.2$, etc., which indicate the nested sequence of interactions.

### **Steps to Make Collaboration Diagram**

1. Find the domain classes
2. Draw objects for the domain classes
3. Add a control object
4. Draw boundary object (like UI)
5. Draw Actor
6. Add Association
7. Adding Messages (Methods)
