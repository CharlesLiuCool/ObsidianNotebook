*Software engineers*, the unseen architects, design and build the digital world, ensuring smooth operations and innovation.

We are building a digital landscape.

*Software* is a collection of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.

### **Characteristics of Software**
- *Intangibility*: Software can't be touched
- *Complexity*: Software can be extremely complex, millions of lines of code
- *Changeability*: Easy to modify after made
- *Reusability*: Easy to replicate
- *Non-wearability*: Immune from wear and tear

*Hardware Failure Rate*
- Bathtub Curve
- Stable period with low failure rate

### **Types of Software**

- *System Software* (e.g. Windows OS)
- *Application Software* (e.g. Microsoft Word)
- *Development Software*
- *Embedded Software* (e.g. software in smart thermostat)
- *Web Software*
- *Mobile Software*

### **Software Engineering**

*Software engineering* applies engineering principles to develop, operate, and maintain reliable and efficient software that meets users needs.

Success requires understanding the *technical* and *human sides* of development

### **Phases of Software Engineering**

- *Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)*: The process followed to develop software, typically including phases such as planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

- *Requirements Analysis*: The process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. For example, when developing an e-commerce website, software engineers must gather requirements from both customers and business stakeholders to ensure the site meets user needs.

- *Design*: Creating a blueprint for the software architecture, components, interfaces, and data

- *Implementation*: Writing the actual code according to the design specifications

- *Testing*: Evaluating the software to ensure it meets the required standards and functions as intended

- *Maintenance*: Updating and improving the software post-deployment to fix bugs, add new features, or enhance performance
