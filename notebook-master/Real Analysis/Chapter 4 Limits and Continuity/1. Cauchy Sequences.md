>**Definition** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space.
>${\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty \subset M}$
>${\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty}$ converges to ${x \in M}$, denoted by ${x_n \to x}$ as ${n \to \infty}$, if for any ${\epsilon > 0}$, there is ${N \in \Bbb{N}}$ such that ${d(x_n,x) < \epsilon}$ for all ${n \ge N}$.
>i.e.
>${x_n \to x \iff d(x_n,x)\to 0 \text{ in } \Bbb{R}}$

**Example** Let ${\{x_n\} \subseteq \Bbb{R}}$ be an increasing sequence and bounded above. (i.e. ${x_n \le x_{n+1}})$
Then ${x_n \to x = \sup\{x_n\}}$
Similarly, if ${\{x_n\}}$ is decreasing and bounded below, then ${x_n \to x = \inf\{x_n\}}$

**Example** In ${\Bbb{C}}$, let ${\Bbb{Z}_n = 1 + \frac{1}{n^2} + (2-\frac{1}{n})i}$. Then ${z_n \to 1 + 2 i}$.

(Hint) ${d(z_n, 1+2i) = |z_n - (1+2i)| = |\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n}i| = (\frac{1}{n^4} + \frac{1}{n^2})^{\frac{1}{2}} \to 0}$ as ${n \to \infty}$.

>**Theorem.** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space. A sequence ${\{x_n\}}$ can converge to at most one point in ${M}$.
>
*Proof:*
> Assume ${x_n \to x}$ and ${x_n \to y}$
> Then ${0 \le d(x,y) \le d(x,x_n) + d(x_n,y)}$
> We know as ${n \to \infty}$, ${d(x,x_n) \to 0}$ and ${d(x_n,y) \to 0}$, so ${d(x,x_n) + d(x_n,y) \to 0}$.
> ${\implies d(x,y) = 0 \implies x = y}$

**Example** In ${\Bbb{R}, \frac{1}{n} \to 0}$ as ${n \to \infty}$.
But in ${M = (0,1], \{\frac{1}{n}_{n=1}^\infty\}}$ does NOT converge
(since ${0 \notin M}$)

>**Theorem.** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space.
>${\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty \subset M}$. Let ${T = \{x_1, x_2, ...\}}$ the range of ${\{x_n\}}$ (a set).
>Suppose ${x_n \to x}$ in ${M}$.
>Then
>1. ${T}$ is bounded
>2. ${x}$ is an adherent point of ${T}$.
> 
> *Proof:*
>    1. Since ${x_n \to x}$, there exists ${N \in \Bbb{N}}$ such that for ${n \ge N}$, ${x_n \in B(x,1)}$.
> Take ${r = 1 + \max\{d(x,x_1),...,d(x,x_{N-1})\}}$
> Then ${x_n \in B(x,r) \forall n=1,2,...}$
> ${i.e. T \subseteq B(x,r)}$ bounded
>    2. Since for every ${\epsilon > 0}$, ${B(x, \epsilon)}$ contains a point of ${T}$
> ${\implies x}$ is an adherent point of ${T}$.

>**Theorem.** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space, and ${T \subseteq M}$. Suppose ${x \in M}$ is an adherent point of ${T}$. Then there is a sequence ${\{x_n\} \subset T}$ that converges to ${x}$.
>
>*Proof:*
>If ${x \in T}$, then take ${x_n = x\;\forall\;n}$
>If ${x \notin T}$, for every ${n \ge 1}$, there is a point ${x_n \in T}$ with ${d(x,x_n) < \frac{1}{n}}$, since ${x}$ is an adherent point of ${T}$.
>Thus, ${d(x,x_n)\to 0}$ as ${n \to \infty}$.
>${i.e. x_n \to x}$.

## **Cauchy Sequence**

Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space. ${\{x_n\} \subset M}$ is a *Cauchy sequence* if for every ${\epsilon > 0}$, there exists ${N \in \Bbb{N}}$ such that
${d(x_n,x_m) < \epsilon}$ for all ${n,m \ge N}$.

>**Theorem.** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space. Suppose ${\{x_n\} \subset M}$ converges to ${x}$. Then ${\{x_n\}}$ is a Cauchy sequence.
>
>*Proof:* For any ${\epsilon > 0}$, there exists ${N \in \Bbb{N}}$ such that ${d(x_n, x) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}}$ for all ${n \ge N}$
>Thus for ${n \ge N, m \ge N}$
>${\begin{align}d(x_n, x_m) &< d(x_n, x) + d(x,x_m) \\ &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon \end{align}}$
>${\implies \{x_n\}}$ is Cauchy.

>**Theorem.** In ${\Bbb{R}^n}$ every Cauchy sequence is a convergent sequence.
>*Proof:*
>Let ${\{x_n\}}$ be a Cauchy sequence. Let ${T = \{x_1,x_2,..\}}$ be the range of the sequence.
>Claim: ${T}$ is bounded.
>Take ${\epsilon = 1}$. Since ${\{x_n\}}$ is Cauchy, there exists ${N \in \Bbb{N}}$ such that ${d(x_n,x_m) < 1 \; \forall\; n \ge N}$.
>In particular, ${d(x_n,x_N) < 1 \; \forall n \ge N}$.
>i.e. ${x_n \in B(x_N, 1) \;\forall\;n \ge N}$.
>Take ${r = \max\{d(x_1,x_N), ...,d(x_{N-1},x_N\} + 1}$
>Then ${x_n \in B(x_N, r) \; \forall\; n \in N}$
>${\implies T}$ is bounded.
>${(i)}$ If ${T}$ is finite, then there exists a subsequence ${x_{n_{k}} = x, k = 1,2,...}$
>Since ${\{x_n\}}$ is Cauchy, for any ${\epsilon > 0}$, ${\exists M \in \Bbb{N}}$ s.t. ${d(x_n,x_m) < \epsilon \;\forall\;n,m \ge M}$.
> Thus ${d(x_n,x) = d(x_n,x_{n_k})<\epsilon}$.
