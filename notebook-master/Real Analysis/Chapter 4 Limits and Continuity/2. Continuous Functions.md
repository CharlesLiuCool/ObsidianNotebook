>**Definition** Let ${(M,d_M)}$, ${(S,d_S)}$ be metric spaces.
>${f: M \to S}$.
>${f}$ is *continuous at ${a \in M}$* if for every ${\epsilon > 0}$ there is a ${\delta > 0}$ such that if ${d_M(x,a) < \delta}$, then ${d_S(f(x), f(a)) < \epsilon}$.
>i.e. for every ${\epsilon > 0}$ there exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that
>$${f(B_m(a,\delta)) \subseteq B_s(f(a), \epsilon)}$$
>${f}$ is *continuous* if ${f}$ is continuous at every ${a \in M}$
>*Remark*
>1. If ${a \in M}$ is an accumulation point, then ${f}$ is continuous at ${a \in M}$
>   ${\iff \lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)}$
>2. If ${a \in M}$ is an isolated point, then ${f}$ is always continuous at ${a}$.
