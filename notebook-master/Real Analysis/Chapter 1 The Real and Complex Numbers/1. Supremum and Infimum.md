### **Supremum and Infimum**

>**Definition:** Let ${S \subseteq R}$
>
If there exists ${b \in \Bbb{R}}$ such that ${x \le b \;\forall\; x  \in S}$, then ${b}$ is called an *upper bound* for ${S}$.
>
We say that ${S}$ is bounded above by ${b}$.
>
If an upper bound ${b}$ for ${S}$ is also in ${S}$, then ${b}$ is called the *maximum element* of ${S}$.
>
We write ${b = \max S}$ (if it exists).

Definitions of *lower bound*, *bounded below*, *minimum element*, can be formulated similarly.

**Example** ${\Bbb{R}^+ = (0, \infty)}$
- unbounded above
- no maximum element
- bounded below by ${0}$ but no minimum element

**Example** ${\Bbb{R}^+ = (0, \infty)}$
- unbounded above
- no maximum element
- bounded below by ${0}$ but no minimum element

>**Definition:** Let ${S \subseteq R}$ bounded above.
>
${b \in \Bbb{R}}$ is called a *least upper bound* for ${S}$ of a *supremum* of ${S}$ if it satisfies
>
${1.}$ ${b}$ is an upper bound for ${S}$
${2.}$ For any ${x < b}$, ${x}$ is *NOT* an upper bound for ${S}$.
>
We denote ${b = \sup S}$

The *greatest lower bound*, or *infimum*, of ${S}$, denoted by ${\inf S}$, is defined in similar ways.

### **The Completeness Axiom for Real Numbers**

Every nonempty set ${S}$ of real numbers which is bounded above has a finite supremum.

As a consequence, every nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded below has an infimum.

#### **Some Properties of the Supremum**

>**Theorem.** Let ${S \subseteq R}$, ${S \neq \phi}$ with ${b = \sup S}$ (${b}$ could be ${\infty}$). Then for every ${a < b}$, there is ${x \in S}$ such that ${a < x \le b}$.
>
*Proof:* Since ${b = \sup S}$, ${x \le b \; \forall\;x \in S}$ by the definition of supremum.
Suppose there is no ${x \in S}$ such that ${a < x}$
Thus ${x \le a \;\forall\;x\in S}$
${\implies a \ge \sup S = b}$
${\rightarrow\!\leftarrow a < b}$

>**Theorem.** Given nonempty subsets ${A}$. ${B \subseteq \Bbb{R}}$, let ${C \coloneqq \{x+y\,|\,x\in A, y \in B\}}$
Then ${\sup C = \sup A + \sup B}$
>
*Proof:*
If ${\sup A = \infty}$ or ${\sup B = \infty}$, then clearly ${\sup C = \infty}$.
Now let ${\sup A = a < \infty}$ and ${\sup B = b < \infty}$.
Let ${c = \sup C}$.
We want to show ${a + b = c}$.
For any ${z \in C, z = x + y, x \in A, y \in B}$.
So ${z = x + y \le a + b}$ and hence ${c \le a + b}$ as the supremum is defined as the smallest upper bound, and ${a + b}$ is an upper bound of ${C}$.
Claim: ${a + b \le c}$
For any ${\epsilon > 0}$, there exists ${x \in A}$ and ${y \in B}$ such that ${a - \epsilon < x, b - \epsilon < y}$.
${\implies a + b - 2 \epsilon < x + y \le c}$, since ${x + y \in C}$.
Thus ${a + b < c + 2 \epsilon \; \forall \; \epsilon > 0}$
${\implies a + b \le c}$.
