## **Point Set Topology in Metric  Spaces**

Given a metric space ${(M,d)}$
For ${a \in M, r \in \Bbb{R}, r > 0,}$
${B(a,r) := \{x \in M \,|\, d(x,a) < r\}}$

For ${S \subseteq M, a \in S}$, ${a}$ is an *interior point* of ${S}$ if there exists ${B(a,r) \subseteq S}$

The open sets, closed sets, adherent points, and accumulation points are defined in similar ways as in ${\Bbb{R}^n}$.

>**Theorem**
>1. The arbitrary union of open sets is open. The finite intersection of open sets is open.
>2. The arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed. The finite union of closed sets is closed.

>**Theorem** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space. Let ${S \subset M}$. Then the following are equivalent.
>1. ${S}$ is closed
>2. ${S}$ contains all its adherent points.
>3. ${S}$ contains all its accumulation points.
>4. ${S = \bar{S}}$
> *Recall:* ${\bar{S} = }$the set of all adherent points of ${S}$. (the closure of ${S}$).

**Example** ${(\Bbb{R}, |\cdot |)}$
${\Bbb{Q} \subseteq \Bbb{R}}$.
${\bar{\Bbb{Q}} = \Bbb{R}}$.
${Q}$ is *dense* in ${\Bbb{R}}$.

**Example** ${(\Bbb{Q}), | \cdot |}$
Let ${S = \Bbb{Q} \cap (\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2})}$
${\bar{S} = S \implies S}$ is closed in ${\Bbb{Q}}$.
