## **Compact Subsets of a Metric Space**

>**Definition** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space. ${S \subset M}$ is *compact* if every open covering of ${S}$ contains a finite subcover.

>**Theorem.** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space. Suppose ${S \subset M}$ is compact.
Then ${S}$ is closed and bounded.

*Remark* The proof is the same as in ${(\Bbb{R}^n, ||\cdot||)}$. However, the converse is *NOT* true for general metric spaces.

>**Theorem.** Let ${V}$ be a finite dimensional normed linear space over ${\Bbb{R}}$ or ${\Bbb{C}}$.
Then ${S \subset V}$ is compact if and only if ${S}$ is closed and bounded.

>**Definition** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space.
${S \subset M}$ is *limit point compact* if every infinite subset of ${S}$ has an *accumulation point* in ${S}$.

>**Definition** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space. ${S \subset M}$ is *sequentially compact* if every sequence of points in ${S}$ has a convergent subsequence in ${S}$.

>**Theorem.** Let ${(M,d)}$ be a metric space. ${S \subseteq M}$. Then the following are equivalent:
>1. ${S}$ is compact
>2. ${S}$ is limit point compact
>3. ${S}$ is sequentially compact
