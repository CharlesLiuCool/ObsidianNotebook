>**Definition** ${S \subseteq \Bbb{R}^n}$ is *closed* if ${\Bbb{R}^n \setminus S}$ is open.

**Example:** ${[a,b] \subseteq R}$ is closed.

**Example:** ${[a_1,b_1] \times [a_2,b_2] \times ... \times [a_n,b_n] \subseteq \Bbb{R}^n}$ is closed.

>**Theorem.**
>1. The union of a finite collection of closed sets is closed
>2. The intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is closed.

(Hint)
${(\bigcup\limits_{i\in\wedge}A_i)^C = \bigcap\limits_{i\in\wedge}A_i^C}$
${(\bigcap\limits_{i\in\wedge}A_i)^C = \bigcup\limits_{i\in\wedge}A_i^C}$

**Theorem.** Suppose ${A}$ is open and ${B}$ is closed.
Then
1. ${A \setminus B}$ is open
2. ${B \setminus A}$ is closed

(Hint)
1. ${A \setminus B = A \cup B^C}$
2. ${B \setminus A = B \cup A^C}$
