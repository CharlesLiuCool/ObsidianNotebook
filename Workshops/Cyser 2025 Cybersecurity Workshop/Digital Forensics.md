Collect evidence to support a legal case

Collect, analyze, and interpret digital evidence

*Types of Digital Forensics*
- Memory
- Disk
- Network
- Live

*Memory Forensics*
Analysis of data sources from a running system's memory (RAM)

*Disk Forensics*
- Investigate magnetic and solid-state disks
- Typically used when you:
	- Cannot access the running state of the system
	- Investigating historical activity
- A file may never be deleted, even if you 'delete' it

*Network and Live Forensics*

*Types of Digital Data*
- Open Computer Systems
	- Desktop computer
	- Laptop computer
- Embedded Computer Systems
	- Medical devices
	- Controller in vehicles
	- Smart cards
	- Mobile devices
- Network Systems
	- WiFi
	- Routers

*Evidence Collection*
- Context is critical
- Need to establish the scope of systems and evidence collections plans
	- What evidence do we need to support our investigation?
	- What capture tools do we need?
- Critical to follow appropriate processes and procedures

*Principles of Evidence Collection*
1. No action should change the data
2. If accessing original data - must be competent, explain relevance and implications of actions
3. Audit trail or record of all process applied must be created and preserved
4. Person in charge of the case has the overall responsibility for ensuring laws and principles are followed

*Evidence Exchange*
- **Locard's Exchange Principle**
	- Contact between two items will result in an exchange
	- Every contact leaves a trace
- Anyone or anything entering a crime scene
	- Takes something of the scene with them
	- Leaves something behind at the scene

*Integrity and Soundness*
- We use message digest (hash) functions to perform this work for us
	- SHA256 is common, however some tools only support MD5 and SHA1
- How was the evidence handled (preserved and examined)
	- Documentation
