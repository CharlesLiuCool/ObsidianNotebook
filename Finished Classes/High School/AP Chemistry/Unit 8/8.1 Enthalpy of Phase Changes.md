This is the *heating curve* for ice:

![[Ice Heating Curve.png]]

> [!question]- Where on the graph is the temperature increasing?
> A to B, C to D, and E to F

>[!question]- Where is it *NOT* increasing?
> B to C and D to E

At these areas where the temperature is not happening, **PHASE CHANGING** is occuring!

> [!question]- How much energy will it take to heat 155 grams of ice from -5℃ to 0℃? 
> 1. From 5 to 0${\degree}$C, the ${\text{H}_2\text{O}}$ is in solid state (ice).
> 2. We know that ${q = mc\Delta}t$
> 3. ${ q = 2.06 \text{J/g} \degree C}$
> 4. ${m = 155g}$
> 5. ${\Delta = 0 - (-5) \degree C = 5 \degree C}$

| Substance | Specific Heat |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| ${\text{H}_2\text{O}}$(s) | 2.06 J/g${\degree}$C |
| ${\text{H}_2\text{O}}$(l) | 4.18 J/g${\degree}$C |
| ${\text{H}_2\text{O}}$(g) | 2.02 J/g${\degree}$C |
