A *clique* in a graph ${G}$ is a complete subgraph of ${G}$.
The order of the largest clique in a graph ${G}$ is its *clique number*, ${\omega(G)}$.

**Example:**

${\alpha(G) = 4}$
${\omega(\bar{G}) = 4}$

**Theorem.** For every graph of order ${n}$,
$${\chi(G) \ge \omega(G)\;\;\&\;\;\chi(G) \ge \frac{n}{\alpha(G)}}$$
