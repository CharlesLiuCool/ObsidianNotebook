### **Review**

*Cycle:* The only repeated vertex is the first being the last closed walk.
*Trail:* No edge is repeated
*Circuit:* Closed trail
*Path:* A walk with no repeated vertices
*Bipartite Graph:* A graph is bipartite ${\iff}$ it has no odd cycles.

When we list the degrees of all the vertices of a graph ${G}$ in a sequence ${s}$, then ${s}$ is called a **degree sequence**.

A finite sequence of nonnegative integers is called **graphic** if its a degree sequence of some graph.

>**Havel-Hakimi Theorem**
**Theorem.** Given two finite sequences of integers is non-increasing order:
${(1)\,s,t_1,t_2,...,t_s,d_1,d_2,...,d_k}$
${(2)\,t_1-1,t_2-1,...,t_s-1,d_1,d_2,...,d_k}$
Then ${(1)}$ is graphic if and only if ${(2)}$ is graphic.
*Proof.*

**Example 1.** ${5,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,1}$
>[!check]- Solution
${3,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,1}$
Reorder
${3,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1}$
${1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}$

**Example 2.** ${7,7,4,3,3,3,2,11}$
${}$

Degree sequences are not necessarily unique.

**Example 1.** ${2,2,2,2,2,2}$
Make 2 graphs that are *NOT* isomorphic with the degree sequence.

*Sketch of Proof*

${(1) \implies (2)}$
${(2) \implies (1)}$
${(2) \implies (1)}$

WTS: If ${(2)}$ is graphic, then ${(1)}$ is graphic.
If ${(2)}$ is graphic, make a graph with this degree sequence.
Label the vertices with degree  ${t_{1} - 1}$ "${T_{i}}$" and the vertices with degree ${d_i}$ "${D_i}$".

Add a vertex ${S}$ to this graph. Add one edge between each of ${t_1, t_2, ... t_s}$. In other words, add edges ${ST_i}$ for ${i \le i \le s}$
Now ${\deg T_i}$

**Example 3.** ${5,4,3,3,2,2,2,1,1,1}$
${3,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,1}$

**Example 4.** ${7,7,4,3,3,3,2,1}$
${6,3,2,2,2,1,0}$
