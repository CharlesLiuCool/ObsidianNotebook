## **Graphs and Isomorphism**

*Reminder:* A *function* is a relation that maps a set of inputs to a set of outputs where each input is mapped to exactly one output.

A *bijection* is a function ${f: A \to B}$ that is both "one-to-one" (an *injection*) and "onto" (a *surjection*).

The function ${f}$ is one-to-one if for ${a_1, a_2 \in A}$ and ${a_1 \neq a_2}$, then ${f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)}$.

The function ${f}$ is onto if for every ${b \in B}$, there exists ${a \in A}$ such that ${f(a) = b}$.

A bijection is a mechanism for perfectly matching the elements in ${A}$ to those in ${B}$. If there is a bijection between ${A}$ and ${B}$, then ${A}$ and ${B}$ have the same number of elements.

A *graph isomorphism* from ${G}$ to ${H}$ is a bijection ${\phi: V(G) \to V(H)}$ such that ${uv \in E(G)}$ if and only if ${\phi(u)\phi(v) \in E(H)}$.

In other words, ${\phi}$ preserves adjacencies.

For all ${u,v \in V(G)}$, ${u}$ is adjacent to ${v}$ in ${G}$ if and only if ${\phi(u)}$ is adjacent to ${\phi(v)}$.

If there is an isomorphism between ${G}$ and ${H}$, we say that ${G}$ and ${H}$ are *isomorphic*.

*Notation:* ${G \cong H}$.

**Examples:**

![[8. Isomorphism 2025-02-12 14.23.49.excalidraw|700]]

${\phi(1) = a}$
${\phi(3) = b}$
${\phi(5) = c}$
${\phi(2) = d}$
${\phi(4) = e}$
There's 5P5 bijections, or ${5!}$

In order for two graphs to be isomorphic, there must be a bijection between their vertex sets. This means they at least have to have the same order.


### **Isomorphic Graphs and Degrees**

**Theorem.** If ${G}$ and ${H}$ are isomorphic graphs, then the degrees of the vertices of ${G}$ are the same as the degrees of the vertices of ${H}$

*Proof:*
Suppose ${G \cong H}$
Let ${u \in V(G)}$. Then ${\phi(u) = v}$ for some ${v \in V(H)}$.
WTS that ${\deg_G(u) = \deg_H(v)}$.
Suppose ${u}$ is adjacent to ${x_1,x_2,...,x_k \in V(G)}$ and not adjacent to ${w_1, w_2, ..., w_l \in V(G)}$.
Then ${\phi(u) = v}$ is adjacent to ${\phi(x_1), \phi(x_2), ... \phi(x_k) \in V(H)}$ and ${y(u) = v}$ is *not* adjacent to ${y(w_1),...,y(w_l) \in V(H)}$.

Therefore, ${\deg_G u = k = \deg_H v}$

It is not sufficient to only examine degrees.

**Theorem.** Graph isomorphism is an equivalence relation
*Proof:*
Reflexivity: ${G \cong G}$
Symmetry: If ${G \cong H}$, then ${H \cong G}$
Transitivity, if ${G \cong H}$, and${H \cong K}$, then ${G \cong K}$.
Use composition functions.

Two graphs are isomorphic if *there exists* a bijection that preserves adjacencies.

To prove that graphs ${G}$ and ${H}$ are not isomorphic, it is not sufficient to find just one bijection that doesn't preserve adjacencies, *every* bijection must not preserve adjacencies.
