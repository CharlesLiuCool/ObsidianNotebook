A graph ${H}$ is called a **subgraph** of graph ${G}$, written ${H \subset G}$ if ${V(H) \subseteq V(G)}$ and ${E(H) \subset E(G)}$

If ${H \subseteq G}$ and ${V(H) = V(G)}$ then we call ${H}$ a **spanning subgraph**. In other words, it has all the vertices, but not necessarily the edges.

A subgraph ${F}$ of a graph ${G}$ is called an **induced subgraph** of ${G}$ if whenever ${u}$ and ${v}$ are vertices of ${F}$ and ${uv}$ is an edge of ${G}$, then ${uv}$ is an edge of ${F}$ as well.

The **subgraph** of ${G}$ **induced** by ${S}$ is the induced subgraph with vertex set ${S}$. Notation ${G[S]}$

A ${u-v\,}$  **walk** ${W}$ in ${G}$ is a sequence of vertices in ${G}$, beginning with ${u}$ and ending at ${v}$ such that consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent

$${W = (u = v_0,v_1,...v_{k-1},v_k = v)}$$
${k \ge 0}$; ${v_i}$ and ${v_{i+1}}$ are adjacent for ${i = 0, 1, 2, ... ,k-1}$.
Walks can repeat vertices.


If ${u = v}$, then the walk ${W}$ is **closed**; if ${u \neq v}$, ${W}$ is open.

The number of edges traversed in the walk (including multiple occurrences of an edge) is called the **length** of the walk, denoted ${|W|}$

**Trivial walk** is a walk that only traverses one vertex and has length 0.

![[Untitled 2025-01-13 14.29.40.excalidraw|500]]
${W = (1,2,5,6,5,2,1)}$ is closed, ${|W| = 6}$
${R = (1,2,5,6,7)}$ is open, ${|R| = 4}$
Red part is a **circuit**, see below.
Green part is a **cycle**, see below.

A **trail** is a walk in which no edge is traversed more than once.

A **path** is a walk in which no vertices are repeated.

The **distance** between ${u}$ and ${v}$ is the length of a shortest ${u - v}$ path.

Notation: ${d(u,v)}$ or ${d(v,u)}$

If there is no ${u - v}$ path, then ${d(u,v) = \infty}$

${d(u,u) = 0}$ 

>[!question] Example 7.
Is it possible to repeat vertices but not repeat edges in a walk? In other words, can we have a trail that is not a path?

>[!check]- 
No

**Theorem.** If a graph ${G}$ contains ${u - v}$ walk of length ${l}$, then ${G}$ contains a ${u - v}$ path of length at most ${l}$
*Proof.* Let ${W}$ be a ${u-v}$ walk of length ${l}$
If ${W}$ is a path, we are done (we have a path of length ${l})$
If ${W}$ is not a path, then ${W}$ repeats a vertex, say ${V_s*}$.
So ${W = (u = v_0, v_s*, ... , v_s*, ..., v_k = v)}$
Remove the vertices between the repeated ${v_s*}$ and remove one ${v_s*}$.
So ${P = (u = v_0, ... , v_s*, ... , v_k = v)}$
Repeat the process until there is no more repeated vertices. Our final path will be less than or equal to ${l}$

A **circuit** is a closed trail (no repeated edges).

A **cycle** is a circuit that does not repeat a vertex, except for the first vertex.

A **k-cycle** is a cycle of length ${k}$. An **odd cycle** is a cycle of odd length; an **even cycle** is a cycle of even length.

Green is an *even cycle*.

If ${G}$ contains a ${u-v}$ path, then ${u}$ and ${v}$

**Theorem.** Let ${G}$ be a graph and ${u, v \in V(G)}$
If ${\sim}$ is the relation defined on ${V(G)}$ by ${u \sim v}$ if ${u}$ is connected to ${v}$, then ${\sim}$ is an equivalence relation.

*Proof.*
Equivalence
Reflexivity: Want to show ${u \sim u\,\forall\,u \in V(G)}$
${u \sim u\,\forall\,u \in V(G)}$ by the trivial walk. ${u}$.
Symmetry: Want to show if ${u \sim v}$ then ${v~u}$. If there is a ${u-v}$ path, follow the path backwards and you got a ${u-v}$ path.
Transitivity: Want to show if ${u \sim v}$ and ${v \sim w}$, then ${u \sim w}$
Concatenate the ${u-v}$ path and the ${v-w}$ path to form a ${u-w}$ walk. This might not be a path; remove vertices between repeated vertices until we have a path.

___

Since ${\sim}$ is an equivalence relation, it produces equivalence classes:
$${[u] = \{x \in V\,|\,x \sim u\}}$$

How do equivalence classes ${[u]}$ and ${[v]}$

${[u] = \{ x \in V\,|\,x \sim u\}}$
${[v] = \{ x \in V\,|\,x \sim V\}}$

*Case 1:* ${u}$ and ${v}$ are connected.
${[u] = [v]}$
*Case 2:* ${u}$ and ${v}$ are not connected.
${[u]  \cap [v] = \emptyset}$

A connected subgraph of ${G}$ that is not a proper subgraph of any other connected subgraph of ${G}$ is a *component of ${G}$*

Alternative definition: The *component of ${G}$ that contains ${v}$* is the induced subgraph ${G([v])}$

**Example 10.**
![[2. Terms and Definitions 2025-01-15 14.47.02.excalidraw]]

${[2] = \{x \in V | x \sim 2\} = \{1,2,3,4\}}$
${[3] = \{1,2,3,4\}}$
${[5] = \{5,6,7\}}$

As we can see,
${[2] = [3]}$
${[5] \neq [7]}$

${G([2]) = G\{1,2,3,4\}}$:
Also ${G([3])}$

The number of components in a graph ${G}$ is denoted by ${\kappa(G)}$.

In the previous graph, ${\kappa(G) = 2}$

A graph of ${G}$ is *connected* if every pair of vertices in ${G}$ is connected. A graph ${G}$ that is not connected is called *disconnected*.

Alternative definition:
${G}$ is *connected* if and only if ${\kappa(G) = 1}$.
