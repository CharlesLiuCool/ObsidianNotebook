For two graphs ${G}$ and ${H}$, the **Cartesian product** ${G \times H}$ has vertex set ${V(G \times H) = V(G) \times V(H)}$. That is, every vertex of ${G \times H}$ is an ordered pair ${(u,v)}$, where ${u \in V(G)}$ and ${v \in V(H)}$.

${A = \{a,b,c\}, B = \{1,2\}}$
${A \times B = \{(x,y)\,|\,x\in A, y\in B\}}$ 
${A \times B = \{(a,1), (a,2), (b,1), (b,2), (c,1), (c,2)\}}$

**Example 20.** ${P_2 \times C_3}$
${V(P_2) = \{0,1\}}$

${Q_n}$: The **Cube graph**
$${V = \{\text{binary n-tuples}\}}$$
Two vertices are joined by a single edge if and only if they differ in exactly one position.

**Example 22.** ${Q_2}$ (Subscript does not indicate ${|V|}$ (# of vertices)

${V = \{00, 01, 10, 11\}}$
![[4. 2025-01-27 14.27.45.excalidraw]]

**Example 23.** ${Q_3}$
${V = \{000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111\}}$

**Example 24.** ${Q_4}$
${4}$- dimensional cube.

A **weighted graph** is a graph where each edge is assigned a real number, called its **weight**.

**Example 1.**

Weighted graph can be used
- in image processing, where the weight of the edges represents the similarity between two pixels.
- to represent transportation networks (GPS navigation, transportation-planning)

The graph below models cities in the US and airplane routes between cities. Each edge weight indicates the length of the trip between the cities (in miles).

Use Djikstra's algorithm to find a shortest path between Honolulu and Providence.
