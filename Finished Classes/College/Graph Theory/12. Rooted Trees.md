 A *rooted tree* (${T}$,${r}$) is a tree ${G}$ with a distinguished root, usually at the top.

**Definitions**: Given a rooted tree ${(T,r)}$ and two distinct vertices ${u}$ and ${w}$ is a descendent of ${u}$.
If additionally, ${u}$ and ${w}$ are adjacent vertices, then ${u}$ is the parent of ${w}$ and ${w}$ is a child of ${u}$.

If ${u}$ and ${w}$ have the same parent, ${u}$ and ${w}$ are siblings.

*Lemma*
For every edge ${e = uv}$, of a rooted tree
