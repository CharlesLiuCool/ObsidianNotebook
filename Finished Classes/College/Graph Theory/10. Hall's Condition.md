> **Matchings** p. 184 of Chartrand and Zhang
> **Definition.** A *matching* in a graph ${G}$ is an independent set of edges.
> 
> A set of edges in a graph is *independent* if no two edges in the set are adjacent.
>  
>  More formally:
>  Let ${G}$ be a bipartite graph with partite sets ${U}$ and ${W}$ where ${r = |U| \le |W|}$.
>  
>  A matching in ${G}$ is a set of edges ${M = \{e_1, e_2,...e_m\}}$ where ${e_i = \{\}}$ for ${1 \le i \le k}$ such that \__ are ${k}$ distinct vertices of ${U}$ and 7__ are ${k}$ distinct vertices of ${W}$.


>**Hall's Condition**
>**Theorem.** Let ${G}$ be a bipartite graph with partite sets ${U}$ and ${W}$ such that ${r = |U| \le |W|}$.
> 
> Then ${G}$ contains a matching of cardinality ${r}$ if and only if ${|N(X)| \ge X}$ for *every* nonempty subset ${X}$ of ${U}$

>**Theorem.** In a collection of ${r}$ women and ${r}$ men, a total of ${r}$ marriages between acquainted men and women is possible if and only if for each
