Recall ${k(G)}$ is the number of component of graph ${G}$.

An edge ${e}$ is a *bridge* if ${k(G - e) = k(G) + 1}$ or a *link* if ${k(G-e) = k(G)}$.

**Theorem.** An edge ${e}$ of a graph ${G}$ is a link if and only if ${e}$ lies on a cycle.

An *acyclic* graph is a graph with no links (i.e. no cycles)

A acyclic graph is also called a *forest*

A connected acyclic graph is a *tree*

**Theorem.** If ${F}$ is a forest, with ${n}$ vertices, ${m}$ edges, and ${k}$ components, then ${n = m + k}$

*Proof:*
Let ${F}$ be a forest with ${n}$ vertices, ${m}$ edges, and ${k}$ components.
All edges are bridges.
