A cycle in a graph ${G}$ that contains every vertex on ${G}$ is called a *Hamiltonian cycle* of ${G}$.

A path in a graph ${G}$ that contains every vertex of ${G}$ is called a *Hamiltonian path* in ${G}$.

Named after Sir William Rowan Hamilton (${1805-1865}$)

**Hamiltonian Graphs**
**Theorem.** If ${G}$ is a graph of order ${n \ge 3}$ such that ${\deg(v) \ge \frac{n}{2}}$ for every vertex ${v \in V(G)}$, then ${G}$ is Hamiltonian.

*Proof.*
Assume ${|V(G)| = n \ge 3}$ & ${\deg v \ge \frac{n}{2}}$,
${\forall v \in V(G)}$
Suppose ${|V(G)| = 3}$, so ${\deg v \ge \frac{3}{2}}$
${\forall v \in V(G)}$.
So ${\deg v = 2\,\forall\,v \in V(G)}$

${G = C_3 = K_3}$

This graph has a Hamiltonian cycle.
So assume ${|V(G)| \ge 4}$
Let ${P = (u_1,u_2,...,u_k)}$ be a longest path in ${G}$.

If ${u_1}$ had a neighbor not on ${P}$, then we could make a longer path by appending this neighbor to the start of ${P}$.
But ${P}$ is a longest path, so all of ${u_is}$ neighbors are on ${P}$.
Similarly, all of ${u_k's}$ neighbors also must be on ${P}$.
Since ${u_1}$ has *at least* ${\frac{n}{2}}$ neighbors, we know that ${P}$ has *at least* ${\frac{n}{2} + 1}$ vertices.

*Claim:* There is a vertex, ${u_i}$ on ${P}$, ${2 \le i \le k}$ such that ${u_1}$ is adjacent to ${u_i}$ and ${u_k}$ is adjacent to ${u_{i-1}}$.

We prove this BWOC.
Assume this is not the case.

So for each ${u_i}$ that is adjacent to ${u_1}$, ${u_{i-1}}$ is *NOT* adjacent to ${u_k}$.

But ${\deg u_1 \ge \frac{n}{2} \implies u_1}$ has at least ${\frac{n}{2}}$ neighbors. We are saying that none of the vertices preceding these vertices on ${P}$ are adjacent to ${u_k}$. So there are ${\frac{n}{2}}$ vertices that are *NOT* adjacent to ${u_k}$

${\deg{u_k} = n-1 - \frac{n}{2} = \frac{n}{2} - 1 \not> \frac{n}{2}}$

${u_k}$ is not adjacent to itself.

But we assumed that ${\deg u_k \ge \frac{n}{2}}$. This is a contradiction. So, there must be at least one instance where ${u_1}$ is adjacent to ${u_i}$ and ${u_k}$ is adjacent to ${u_{i-1}}$ for some ${2 \le i \le k}$.

So we can create a cycle using these vertices:
${C = (u_1,u_i,u_{i+1},...,u_k,u_{i-1}, u_{i-2}, ...,u_2,u_1)}$

BWOC assume there is a vertex ${w}$ not on ${C}$. Since ${C}$ contains at least ${1 + \frac{n}{2}}$ vertices, there are fewer than ${\frac{n}{2}}$ vertices not on ${C}$. ${(n - (\frac{n}{2} + 1)) = \frac{n}{2} - 1 < \frac{n}{2}}$.

Since ${\deg w \ge \frac{n}{2}}$, we must have a neighbor on ${C}$, ${u_j}$.

This contradicts our assumption that ${P}$ is a longest path in ${G}$.

So our assumption that ${C}$ does not contain all the vertices of ${G}$ must be false.
