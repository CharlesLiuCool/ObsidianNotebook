In general, how many edges are in ${K_n}$.

${\begin{pmatrix} n \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}}$

The *complement* ${\bar{G}}$ of a graph ${G}$ is the graph with vertex set ${V(G)}$ (the same as ${G}$), and for every pair ${u,v}$ of vertices in ${G}$, ${uv}$ is an edge of ${\overline{G}}$  if and only if ${uv}$ is *not* an edge in ${G}$

**Theorem.** If ${G}$ is a disconnected graph, then ${\overline{G}}$ is connected.
*Proof.*
We want to show in ${\overline{G}}$, there is a path between every pair of vertices.
In ${\overline{G}}$, ${V(\overline{G}) = V(G)}$. Assume that there is not a path between a pair of vertices.

Let ${u,v \in V(\overline{G})}$

*Case 1:* ${u}$ and ${v}$ are in different components in ${G}$. So, there is no edge joining ${u,v}$ in ${G}$. Thus ${uv \in E(\overline{G})}$
So ${u\;\&\;v}$ are connected in ${\overline{G}}$

*Case 2:* ${u\;\&\;v}$ are in the same component.
Since ${G}$ is disconnected, ${\kappa(G) \ge 1}$

So ${\exists\;w \in V(G)}$ such that ${w}$ is in a different component from than ${u\;\&\;v}$

Since ${w}$ is a different component than ${u\;\&\;v}$, ${uw \notin E(G)}$ and ${vw \notin E(G)}$

Thus, ${uw \in E(\overline{G})}$ and ${vw \in E(\overline{G})}$.
So, ${(u,w,v)}$ is a path in ${\overline{G}}$ and ${u\;\&\;v}$ are connected in ${\overline{G}}$

A graph ${G}$ is a *bipartite graph* if ${V(G)}$ can be partitioned into two subsets ${U}$ and ${V}$, called *partite sets*, such that every edge of ${G}$ joins a vertex of ${U}$ to a vertex of ${V}$.

there are no edges between vertices in ${U}$ or between vertices in ${V}$.

Yes, it's bipartite

If every vertex ${U}$ is adjacent to every vertex of ${W}$, then ${G}$ is a *complete bipartite graph*

Notation: ${K_{m,n}}$ where ${m}$ and ${n}$ are the number of vertices in each partite set.

**Theorem.** A nontrivial graph ${G}$ is bipartite if and only if ${G}$ contains no odd cycles.

"if and only if" ${\iff}$
If ${G}$ is bipartite, then no odd cycles.
If ${G}$ has no odd cycle, then it is bipartite

If, then
${p \implies q}$

Converse
${q \implies g}$

Inverse
${\sim p \implies \sim q}$

Contrapositive
${\sim q \implies \sim p}$

If ${G}$ is bipartite, then ${G}$ has no odd cycles.

Contrapositive:
If ${G}$ has an odd cycle, then it is not bipartite.

*Proof.*
By way of contradiction, suppose that we have an odd cycle, but ${G}$ is bipartite.
Since ${G}$ is bipartite, we can partition ${V(G)}$ into sets ${u\;\&\;v}$ such that ${\forall u \in U\;\&\;\forall v\in V,\; u_1, u_2 \notin E(G) \& v_1, v_2 \in V}$, ${v_1, v_2 \in E(G)}$

Suppose
${z_0, z_1, z_2, ..., z_{2k+1}}$ is an odd cycle in ${G}$.
${z_0 = z_{2k+1}}$

${z_0}$ is either in set ${U}$ or set ${V}$.

WLOG, say ${z_0 \in U}$.

So ${z_1 \in V}$ because ${z_0z_1 \in E(G)}$
${\&\;z_2 \in U}$ because ${z_1z_2 \in E(G)}$
${\&\;z_3 \in V}$
${\&\;z_4 \in U}$

In general ${z_{2n} \in U}$, for ${0 \le 2_n \le 2_{k+1}}$
${z_0 \in U,\; z_{2k+1} \in V}$
But ${z_0 = z_{2k+1}}$. This is a contradiction. Thus, if ${G}$ has no odd cycles, its bipartite.

If ${G}$ has no odd cycle, then ${G}$ is bipartite.
We can assume ${G}$ is connected (A graph is bipartite ${\iff}$ each component is bipartite.)

Let ${u \in V(G)}$
Create two set of vertices:
${u = \{v\,|\, d(u,v) \text{ is even}\}}$
${w = \{v\,|\,d(u,v) \text{ is odd}\}}$

By way of contradiction, assume ${G}$ has no odd cycle, but ${G}$ is not bipartite.

So, since ${G}$ is not bipartite, there exists two vertices in ${U}$ or and ${W}$ that are adjacent.

WLOG, say ${v,w \in W \& vw \in E(G)}$.
Since ${v,w \in W}$, we know ${d(u,v) \& d(u,w)}$ are both odd.
Say 
${d(u,v) = 2s+1}$
${d(u,w) = 2t+1}$,
${s \in \{0,1,2 ...\}}$

Let ${P' = (u = v_0, v_1, v_2, ..., v_{2s+1} =v)}$ be a shortest ${u-v}$ path.
Let ${P'' = (u = w_0, w_1, w_2, ..., w_{2t+1}) = w}$

Note: ${v_0 = w_0 = u}$

There may be other vertices in common between ${P'\;\&\;P''}$.

Suppose ${v_i = w_j}$.

Suppose ${i < j}$.

So ${v_i}$ occurs earlier in the ${u-v}$ path than ${w_k}$ does in the ${u-w}$ path.

NO

Then ${(u = v_0, v_1, ... , v_i=w_j, w_j+1, ... , w_{2t+1} = w)}$
is a shorter ${u-w}$ path than ${P''}$.

This is a *contradiction*, we assumed ${P''}$ was a shortest ${u-w}$ path.

Okay, maybe ${j < i}$.

Maybe we encounter ${w_j}$ earlier in the ${u-w}$ path than we encounter ${v_i}$ in the ${u-v}$ path.

But then ${(u = w_0, w_1, ... w_j = v_i, v_{i+1}, ..., v_{2s+1} = v)}$ is a shorter ${u-v}$ path.

So if ${w_j = v_i}$, then ${i = j}$.

Let ${l}$ be the last time ${v_l = w_l}$.
For all indices higher than ${l}$, no vertex is shared between ${P'\;\&\;P''}$.

Consider
${C = (w_l, ..., w_{2t+1} = w, v = v_{2s+1}, ..., v_{l})}$

${w_l = v_l\;\&}$  we have no repeated vertices, so ${C}$ is a cycle.

${|C| = 2t+1 - l + 2s+1 - l + 1 = 2t + 2s - 2l + 3}$
This is an odd number.
We said ${G}$ had no odd cycle; this is a contradiction.
Our assumption that ${G}$ is not bipartite must be false.
