>[!book] Graph
>Definition. A *graph* ${G}$ is a finite nonempty set of objects called vertices together with a (possibly empty) set of unorder pairs of distinct vertices of ${G}$ called *edges*
>The vertex set of ${G}$ is denoted ${V(G)}$; the *edge set* is denoted ${E(G)}$

Edge ${e = uv}$ is said to *join* the vertices ${u}$ and ${v}$. If ${e = uv}$ is an edge in ${G}$, then ${u}$ and ${v}$ are called *adjacent vertices*. ${u}$ and ${e}$ are *incident*; so are ${v}$ and ${e}$.

${e}$ is incident with ${u}$ with ${v}$.
${v}$ is adjacent to ${u}$ and ${w}$.
The number of elements in a set ${S}$ is called the *cardinality* of ${S}$ and is denoted ${|S|}$

The cardinality of ${V(G)}$ is called the *order* of ${G}$ and is denoted either ${|V(G)|}$ or ${n}$

The cardinality of ${E(G)}$ is called the *size* of ${G}$ and is denoted either ${|E(G)|}$ or ${M}$
