**Definition** A *strong component* in a digraph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph - any two nodes in such a subgraph can be reached from each other, but for any nodes *not* in the strong component, this must fail.

**Theorem**
A graph ${G}$ has a strong orientation if and only if ${G}$ is connected and contains no bridges.

*Proof:*
If ${G}$ has a strong orientation, then ${G}$ is connected & has no bridges.
BWOC, assume ${G}$ has a strong orientation & a bridge, ${e = uv}$
Since ${e = uv}$, either ${(u,v)}$ or ${(v,u)}$ is an arc of the resulting digraph ${D}$.

WLOG, say ${(u,v)}$ is an arc of ${D}$.
Since ${G}$ has a strong orientation, there is a ${u-v}$ path and a ${v-u}$ path in ${D}$.
The ${u-v}$ path is the arc ${(u,v)}$. There is a ${v-u}$ path that is not the arc ${(u,v)}$. But if there is a ${v-u}$ path in ${D}$.
The ${e}$ can't be a bridge, because we have another path, the ${v-u}$ path, that connects the two.
Thus ${e}$ cant be a bridge.

**Definition:** Given a digraph ${D}$ whose strong components are ${D_1,D_2,...,D_k}$, we form the *condensation* of ${D}$, denoted ${D*}$, as the digraph whose nodes are the strong components ${D_1,D_2,...D_k}$, where for ${i \neq j}$, an arc goes from ${D_i}$ to ${D_j}$ if and only if there is an arc in ${D}$ that goes from ${D_i}$ to ${D_j}$ if and only if there is an arc in ${D}$ that goes from a node in ${D_i}$ to a node in ${D_j}$.

**Theorem**
For any digraph ${D}$, its condensation ${D^*}$ is an acyclic digraph.
