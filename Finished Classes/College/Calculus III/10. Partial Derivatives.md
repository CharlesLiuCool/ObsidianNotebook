For ${f(x,y)}$, the partial derivative of ${f}$ with respect to ${x}$, denoted ${\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}}$, represents the instantaneous rate of change of ${f(x,y)}$ with respect to ${x}$ *while holding ${y}$ fixed*. That is

$${\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h}}$$

${\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}}$ is found by applying known derivative rules to the ${f(x,y)}$ expression while treating the character ${y}$ as if it represents a constant

Similarly,
$${\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(x,y+h)-f(x,y)}{h}}$$

and ${\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}}$ is found by using known derivative rules while treating ${y}$ as the variable and ${x}$ as the constant.

Graphically:

![[Partial Derivatives Graphic 1|800]]

Notation: partial derivatives at arbitrary variable ${(x,y)}$:

$${\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)=\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}=f_x(x,y) = f_x}$$

$${\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)=\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}=f_y(x,y) = f_y}$$

At a specific point:

$${\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}(2,1)=\left.\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right\vert_{(2,1)}=f_x(2,1)}$$

${\dfrac{df}{dx}}$ *"ordinary"* derivative, indicates that ${f}$ has only one input variable, x.

${\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}}$ *"partial"* derivative, indicates that ${f}$ has inputs other than the variable, x.

## Definition: Differentiability

The function ${z = f(x,y)}$ is **differentiable** at ${(a,b)}$ provided ${f_x(a,b)}$ and ${f_y(a,b)}$ exist and the change ${\Delta z = f(a + \Delta x, b + \Delta y) - f(a,b)}$ equals
$${\Delta z = f_x(a,b)\Delta x + f_y(a,b)\Delta y + \varepsilon_1 \Delta x + \varepsilon_2 \delta y,}$$

trace on the graph of ${f}$ is tangent to the plane.

This is saying there is a plane through ${(a,b, f(a,b))}$ such that no matter how ${(x,y) \to (a,b)}$, the corresponding trace on the graph of ${f}$ is tangent to the plane.

## Theorem 15.5 Conditions for Differentiability
Suppose the function ${f}$ has partial derivatives ${f_x}$ and ${f_y}$ defined on an open set containing ${(a,b)}$, with ${f_x}$ and ${f_y}$ continuous at ${(a,b)}$. Then ${f}$ is differentiable at ${(a,b)}$

___

## Theorem 15.6 Differentiable Implies Continuous
If a function ${f}$ is differentiable at ${(a,b)}$, then it is continuous at ${(a,b)}$.
