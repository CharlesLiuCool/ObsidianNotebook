![[14. Finding Local Extrema for f(x,y) 2024-02-27 08.25.31.excalidraw|800]]

## Definition: Local Maximum/Minimum Values
Suppose ${(a,b)}$ is a point in a region ${R}$ on which ${f}$ is defined. If ${f(x,y) \leq f(a,b)}$ for all ${(x,y)}$ in the domain of ${f}$ and in some open disk centered at ${(a,b)}$, then ${f(a,b)}$ is a **local maximum value** of ${f}$. If ${f(x,y) \geq f(a,b)}$ for all ${(x,y)}$ in the domain of ${f}$ and in some open disk centered at ${(a,b)}$, then ${f(a,b)}$ is a **local minimum value** of ${f}$.

## Definition: Critical Point
${(a,b)}$ is a critical point of ${f}$ if ${(a,b)}$ is in the interior of the domain of ${f}$, and each of ${f_x(a,b)}$ and ${f_y(a,b)}$ is either zero or undefined.

## Theorem 15.14 Derivatives and Local Maximum/Minimum Values
If ${f}$ has a local maximum or minimum value at ${(a,b)}$ and the partial derivatives ${f_x}$ and ${f_y}$ exist...

## Definition: Saddle Point
Consider a function ${f}$ that is differentiable at a critical point ${(a,b)}$. Then ${f}$ has a **saddle point** at ${(a,b)}$ if, in every open disk centered at ${(a,b)}$, there are points ${(x,y)}$ for which ${f(x,y) > f(a,b)}$ and points for which ${f(x,y) < f(a,b)}$

>$${f(x,y) = \dfrac{x^3}{3} - \dfrac{y^3}{3} + 3xy}$$

>[!check]- Solution
>Note polynomials are defined on all real numbers so we can rule out that case
>${f_x = x^2 + 3y = 0}$
>${f_y = -y^3 + 3x = 0}$
>${\implies x = \dfrac{1}{3}y^2}$
>${(\dfrac{1}{3}y^2)^2 + 3y = \dfrac{1}{9}y^4 + 3y = y (y^3 + 27) = 0}$
>${y = 0, -3}$
>So the critical points are ${(0,0)}$ and ${(3, -3)}$

## Theorem 15.15 Second Derivative Test for f(x,y)
Suppose the second partial derivatives of ${f}$ are continuous throughout an open disk centered at the point ${(a,b)}$, where ${f_x(a,b) = f_y(a,b) = 0}$. Let ${D(x,y) = f_{xx}(x,y)f_{yy}(x,y) - (f_{xy})(x,y))^2}$.
1. If ${D(a,b) > 0}$ and ${f_{xx}(a,b) < 0}$, then ${f}$ has a local maximum value at ${(a,b)}$.
2. If ${D(a,b) > 0}$ and ${f_{xx}(a,b) > 0}$, then ${f}$ has a local minimum value at ${(a,b)}$
3. If ${D(a,b) < 0}$, then the test is inconclusive.

>[!question] 24
>Find all critical points, and then test each one using the ${2^{nd}}$ derivative test.
>${f(x,y) = x^4 + y^4 - 4x - 32y + 10}$

>[!check]- Solution
>${f_x = 4x^3 - 4 = 0}$
>${f_y = 4y^3 - 32 = 0}$
>(decoupled system, only one variable in each equation)
>${x^3 = 1, y^3 = 8}$
>${(x,y) = (1,2)}$
>${f_{xx} = 12x^2, f_{yy} = 12y^2, f_{xy} = 0}$, so ${D(x,y) = f_{xx} \cdot f_yy - (f_xy)^2 = (12x^2)(12y^2) - 0^2}$
>So ${D(1,2) = 12(48) - 0^2 > 0}$
> ${f_{xx}(1,2) > 0, f_{yy}(1,2) > 0}$
> Local minimum at ${(1,2)}$

>[!question] 34
>Find and classify all critical points for
>${f(x,y) = x^2 + xy^2 - 2x + 1}$

>[!check]- Solution
>${f_x = 2x + y^2 - 2 = 0}$
>${f_y = 2xy = 0 \implies x = 0}$ or ${y = 0}$
>${y = \pm \sqrt{2}, x = 1}$ 
>
> Critical points are ${(0, \sqrt{2}), (0, -\sqrt{2}), (1,0)}$
> ${D(x,y) = f_{xx} \cdot f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2 = 2 \cdot 2x - (2y)^2 = 4x - 4y^2}$
> ${D(1,0) = 2 \cdot 2 - 0 > 0}$ local minimum at ${(1,0)}$
> ${D(0, \sqrt{2}) = 2(0) - (2\sqrt{2})^2 < 0}$ saddle at ${(0, \pm \sqrt{2})}$
