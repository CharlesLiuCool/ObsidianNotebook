For ${f(x,y)}$, the **gradient** (or **gradient vector**) of ${f}$ is denoted ${\text{grad}(f)}$ or ${\nabla f}$ or ${\nabla f(x,y)}$, and is defined as
$${\nabla f(x,y) = \langle f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y) \rangle}$$

Gradients are an example of something called a **vector field**. At each different point in the xy-plane, the gradient will have a different vector. The input is two dimensional, and the output is two dimensional.

As mentioned previously, the gradient of ${f}$ is a *field*, meaning that the dimensions of its inputs and outputs are the same. Typically, the input for a field is thought of as a location, and the object is thought of as a vector associated with that input location.
For example, for ${f(x,y) = \dfrac{1}{2}x^2 + \dfrac{1}{2}y^2}$, ${\nabla f = \langle x, y \rangle}$
${\nabla f(x,y) = \langle x, y \rangle}$

## Theorem 15.10 Directional Derivative
Let ${f}$ be differentiable at ${(a,b)}$ and let ${{\bf u} = (u_1,u_2)}$
xy-plane. The **directional derivative** of ${f}$ at ${(a,b)}$ in the direction of ${\bf u}$ is 
$${D_u f(a,b) = \langle f_x(a,b), f_y (a,b) \rangle \cdot \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle = \nabla f(a,b) \cdot \vec{u}}$$

**Note:** Given ${f}$ and point ${P}$,

${D_\vec{u} f(p) = \nabla f(P) \cdot \vec{u} = |\nabla f(P)| \cdot |\vec{u}|\cdot \cos(\theta) = |\nabla f(P)|\cos(\theta)}$

So ${D_\vec{u}f(P)}$ has the maximum positive value when ${\theta = 0}$, meaning that ${\vec{u}}$ is in the same direction as ${\nabla f(P)}$ which means
$${\vec{u} = \dfrac{\nabla f(P)}{|\nabla f(P)|}}$$

Also, ${D_\vec{u}f(P)}$ has the minimum negative value when ${\theta = \pi}$, meaning that 
$${\vec{u} = -\dfrac{\nabla f(P)}{|\nabla f(P)|}}$$

It follows that

## Theorem 15.11 Directions of Change
Let ${f}$ be differentiable at ${(a,b)}$ with ${\nabla f(a,b) \neq 0}$.

**Another note:**
Since ${\nabla f(P)}$ points in the direction that will most rapidly increase the value of ${f}$, ${\nabla f(P)}$ must be orthogonal to the level curve of ${f}$ through ${P}$:

## Theorem 15.12 The Gradient

## Theorem 15.13 Directional Derivative and Interpreting the Gradient

Let ${f}$ be differentiable at ${a,b,c}$ and let ${{\bf u} = \langle u_1, u_2, u_3 \rangle}$ be a unit vector. The directional derivative of ${f}$ at ${\langle a,b,c \rangle}$ in the direction of ${\bf u}$
$${D_{\vec{u}}}$$

3. The directional derivative is **zero** in any direction **orthogonal** to ${\nabla f(a,b,c)}$.
4. ${\nabla f(a,b,c)}$ is **orthogonal** to the level surface at ${f}$ containing $\large(a,b,c)$ which has the equation ${f(x,y,z) = k = f(a,b,c)}$.
