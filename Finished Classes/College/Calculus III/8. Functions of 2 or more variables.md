Here's an example of a function with two or more variables: ${f(x,y) = \sqrt{25-x^2-y^2}}$

The **domain** of f is in the set of all ${(x,y)}$ for which ${f(x,y)}$ is defined, which is:
$${25-x^2-y^2 \geq 0}$$
(stuff under square root must be positive)

${D = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2 + y^2 \leq 25 \}}$

The **range** of a function is the set of all achievable output values, which (in this case) is:
for ${f(x,y) = \sqrt{25-x^2-y^2}}$, 

${0 \leq f(x,y) \leq 5}$

So the range is ${[0,5]}$.

The *graph* of ${f}$ is the graph of ${x=f(x,y)}$. That is, call the output z, then graph the resulting relation in ${\mathbb{R}^3}$:
$${f(x,y) = \sqrt{25-x^2-y^2}}$$
$${\implies z = \sqrt{25-x^2-y^2}}$$
Here, (above) ${\implies z^2 = 25 - x^2 - y^2 \implies \underbrace{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25}_{\text{sphere of radius 5, Center } \vec{O}}}$

>[!question] Example
>Sketch a graph of the function. Identify the surface by name, and state its domain and range.
> (25) ${f(x,y) = 6 - x - 2y}$

>[!check]- Solution

>[!check]- Solution
>The domain is ${x \in \mathbb{R}^2}$

>[!question] Example
Graph several level curves of the function in the given window. Label at least two level curves with their z-values.
> (37) ${z = x - y^2,\;\;\;[0,4]\times[-2,2]}$

>[!check]- Solution
> level curves: 
> ${0 = x - y^2 \implies x = y^2}$
> ${1 = x - y^2 \implies x = y^2 + 1}$
> ${k = x-y^2 \implies x = y^2 + k}$

>  $${p(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 9}}$$
>  set output = 0, get 0 = ${\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 9}}$

**NOTE:** A function can have any number of inputs:
${f(x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n)}$, or ${f(\vec{x})}$, where ${\vec{x} = \langle x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n \rangle}$

**Level sets** for such a function are sets of the form
${\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n: f(\vec{x}) = k}$ for various k values
