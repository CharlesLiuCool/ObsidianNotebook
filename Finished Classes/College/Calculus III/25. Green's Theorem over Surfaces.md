## Theorem 17.14 Evaluation of Surface Integrals of Scalar-Valued Functions on Explicitly Defined Surfaces
Let ${f}$ be a continuous function on a smooth surface ${S}$ given by ${z = g(x,y)}$, for ${(x,y)}$ in a region ${R}$. The surface integral of ${f}$ over ${S}$ is
$${\iint\limits_S f(x,y,z)dS = \iint\limits_D f(x,y,g(x,y))\sqrt{g_x^2+g_y^2+1}\,dA}$$

>Let S be the piece of the plane ${z = 8 - x - 2y}$ in the first octant, and let ${f(x,y,z) = e^z}$.
>
>Evaluate ${\begin{align}\iint\limits_Sf(x,y,z)\,dS \end{align}}$

>${g_x = -1, g_y = -2}$, and ${dS = \sqrt{g_x^2+g_y^2 + 1}dA = \sqrt{G}dA}$
>so 
>$${\iint\limits_SfdS = \iint_De^{8-x-2y}\sqrt{G}\,dA = \int_0^4\int_0^{8-2y}e^{8-x-2y}\cdot \sqrt{G}\,dxdy}$$

We can also integrate a *field* over a surface:
![[25. Green's Theorem over Surfaces 2024-04-18 08.25.10.excalidraw]]
${\begin{align} \iint\limits_S\vec{F}\cdot\vec{n}\,dS = (\text{average value of }\vec{F} \cdot \vec{n}\text{ on }\vec{S})(\text{area of }S) = \text{"net upward flux of }S\text{"} \end{align}}$

We need an expression for the upward unit normal ${\vec{n}}$. From last lecture, at a given point on a surface ${S: z=g(x,y)}$, an upward normal vector is ${\langle -g_x, -g_y, 1 \rangle}$, so
$${\vec{n} = \dfrac{\langle -g_x, -g_y, 1 \rangle}{\sqrt{g_x^2 + g_y^2 + 1}}}$$
and
$${\iint\limits_S\langle P,Q,R \rangle \cdot \underbrace{\langle -g_x, -g_y, 1 \rangle \,dA}_{\huge\vec{dS}}}$$

## Definition: Surface Integral of a Vector Field
If ${S}$ is defined in the form ${z = s(x,y)}$, for ${(x,y)}$ in a region ${R}$, then
$${\iint\limits_S {\bf F} \cdot {\bf n} dS = \iint\limits_R(-Pz_x - Qz_y + R)dA}$$

>${\vec{F} = \langle e^{-y}, 2z, xy}$, ${S = \{ (x,y,z): z = \cos(y), |y| \le \pi, - \le x \le 4\}}$
>Find the upward flux of ${\vec{F}}$ through (across) ${S}$

>[!check]- Solution
>Surface is ${z = \cos(y) = g(x,y)}$, so:
>${g_x = 0, g_y = -\sin(y), \vec{dS} = \langle - g_x, -g_y, 1 \rangle dA = \langle 0, \sin(y), 1 \rangle dA}$
>
${\begin{align} \iint\limits_S\vec{F} \cdot \vec{dS} &= \iint\limits_D \langle e^{-y}, 2z, xy \rangle \cdot \langle 0, \sin(y), 1 \rangle dA \\ &= \int_0^4 \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}(2z\sin(y) + xy)\,dydx \\ &= \int_0^4\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}(2\cos(y)\sin(y) + xy)\,dydx \end{align}}$

## Theorem 17.15 Stokes' Theorem
Let ${S}$ be an oriented surface in ${\mathbb{R}^3}$ with a piecewise-smooth closed boundary ${C}$ whose orientation is consistent with that of ${S}$. Assume ${{\bf F} = \langle f, g, h \rangle}$ is a vector field whose components have continuous first partial derivatives on ${S}$. Then
$${\oint\limits_C {\bf F} \cdot d{\bf r} = \iint\limits_S(\nabla \times {\bf F}) \cdot {\bf n}\,dS}$$
where ${\bf n}$ is the unit vector normal to ${S}$ determined by the orientation of ${S}$

## Theorem 17.17 Divergence Theorem
Let ${\bf F}$ be a vector field whose components have continuous first partial derivatives in a connected and simply connected region ${D}$ in ${\mathbb{R}^3}$ enclosed by an oriented surface ${S}$. Then
$${\iint\limits_S {\bf F} \cdot {\bf n}\,dS = \iiint\limits_D \nabla \cdot {\bf F}\,d{\bf V}}$$
where ${\bf n}$ is the outward unit normal vector on ${S}$
