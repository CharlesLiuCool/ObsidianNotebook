## Green's Theorem

**First: Two-dimensional curl & divergence.**

The **curl** of a 2-D field, ${\text{curl}(\vec{F})}$, measures the tendency of the field ${\vec{F}}$ to rotate counterclockwise at any given point:

${\vec{F} = \langle P, Q \rangle = \langle P, 0 \rangle + \langle 0, Q \rangle}$

**Conservative** is synonymous with **irrotational**, ${\text{curl}(\vec{F}) = 0}$ on the region when ${P_y = Q_x}$ on the region.

The **divergence** of a 2-D field, ${\text{div}(\vec{F})}$, measures the tendency of the field ${\vec{F}}$ to "expand" or "diverge" at any given point:
$${\vec{F} = \langle P,Q \rangle = \langle P, 0 \rangle + \langle 0, Q \rangle}$$

${\text{div}(\vec{F}) = P_x + Q_y}$

If ${\text{div}(\vec{F})}$ throughout a region, ${\vec{F}}$ is **incompatible**

## Theorem 17.7 Green's Theorem - Circulation Form
Let ${C}$ be a simple closed piecewise-smooth curve, oriented counterclockwise, that encloses a connected and simply connected region ${R}$ in the plane. Assume ${{\bf F} - \langle f, g \rangle}$, where ${f}$ and ${g}$. have continuous first partial derivatives in ${R}$. Then
$${\oint\limits_C {\bf F} \cdot d {\bf r} = \oint\limits_C f\,dx + g\,dy = \iint\limits_R \left(\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x} - \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)dA}$$
