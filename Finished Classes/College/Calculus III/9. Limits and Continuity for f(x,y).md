## Technical Definition: Limit of a Function of Two Variables
The function ${f}$ has the **limit** L as ${P(x,y)}$ approaches ${P_0(a,b)}$ written
$${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y) = \lim_{P\to P_0}f(x,y) = L,}$$
if, given any ${\epsilon}$, there exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that
$${|f(x,y) - L| < \epsilon}$$
whenever (x,y) is in the domain of ${f}$ and
$${0<V(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2<\delta}$$

2. Linear function
$${f(x,y) = x\;\;\; \lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}x = a}$$

## Theorem 15.2 Limit Laws for Function of Two Variables
Let ${L}$ and ${M}$ be real numbers and suppose
$${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y) = L, \lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}g(x,y) = M}$$
Assume ${c}$ is a constant and ${n > 0}$ is an integer.

1. **Sum** $${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}(f(x,y) + g(x,y)) = L + M}$$
2. **Difference** $${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}(f(x,y) - g(x,y)) = L - M}$$
3.  **Constant Multiple** $${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}cf(x,y) = cL}$$
4. **Product** $${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y)g(x,y) = LM}$$
5. **Quotient** $${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}\dfrac{f(x,y)}{g(x,y)} = \dfrac{L}{M},\;\;\text{ provided M}\neq 0}$$
6. **Power** $${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}(f(x,y))^n = L^n}$$
7. **Root** $${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}(f(x,y))^{1/n} = L^{1/n},\;\;\text{ where we assume } L > 0 \text{ if n is even}}$$

## Procedure: Two Path Test for Nonexistence of Limits
If ${f(x,y)}$ approaches two different values as ${(x,y)}$ approaches ${(a,b)}$ along two different paths in the domain of ${f}$, then
$${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y) \text{ does not exist}}$$

>[!question] (29)
>Prove that the following limits do not exist.
>$${\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \dfrac{x+2y}{x-2y}}$$

>[!check]- Solution
>As ${(x,y) \to (0,0)}$ along the *x-axis*, y is 0, so the original limit becomes
>$${\lim_{x\to 0} \dfrac{x+2(0)}{x-2(0)} = \lim_{x\to0}\dfrac{x}{x} = \lim_{x\to0}(1) = 1}$$
>As ${(x,y) \to (0,0)}$ along the *y-axis*, x is 0, so the original limit becomes
>$${\lim_{y\to 0} \dfrac{0+2y}{0-2y} = \lim_{y\to0}\dfrac{2y}{-2y} = \lim_{y\to0}(-1) = -1}$$
>
>Since $${\lim_{x\to 0}\dfrac{x+2y}{x-2y} = 1 \neq \lim_{y\to 0}\dfrac{x+2y}{x-2y} = -1}$$
>By the **two path test**,
>$${\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \dfrac{x+2y}{x-2y} \text{ is undefined}}$$

>[!question] Example
>Evaluate the following limit or prove it is undefined.
> $${\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \dfrac{xy}{xy^2 + y^2}}$$

>[!check]- Solution
>Here, along ${x}$ or ${y}$ axis we get a limit of ${0}$
>Along ${y = x}$, original limit becomes
>$${\lim_{(x,x)\to(0,0)} \dfrac{x\cdot x}{x^2 + x^2} = \lim_{x\to0}\left(\dfrac{x^2}{2x^2}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2}}$$
>$${\lim_{(x,x)\to(0,0)} \dfrac{xy}{xy^2 + y^2} = \dfrac{1}{2} \neq \lim_{x \to 0} \dfrac{xy}{xy^2 + y^2} = 0}$$
>So by the **two path test**,
>$${\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \dfrac{xy}{xy^2 + y^2} \text{ is undefined }}$$

Polar coordinates for **two path test** only work well when ${(x,y) \to (0,0)}$ (usually).

## Definition: Continuity
The function ${f}$ is continuous at the point ${(a,b)}$ provided

1. ${f}$ is defined at ${(a,b)}$
2. ${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y)}$ exists
3. ${\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y) = f(a,b)}$


The limit laws in [[#Theorem 15.2 Limit Laws for Function of Two Variables]], all translate into continuity laws:

If ${f(x,y)}$ and ${g(x,y)}$ are both continuous at ${(a,b)}$, then so are:
1. ${f(x,y) + g(x,y)}$
2. ${f(x,y) - g(x,y)}$
3. ${f(x,y)g(x,y)}$
4. ${\dfrac{f(x,y)}{g(x,y)}}$ (as long as ${g(a,b) \neq 0}$)

>[!tip] **FACT:**
>Consequently, polynomial and rational functions of ${(x,y)}$ are continuous at all points of their domains.


## Theorem 15.3: Continuity of Composite Functions
If ${u = g(x,y)}$ is continuous at ${(a,b)}$ and ${z = f(u)}$ is continuous at ${g(a,b)}$, then the composite function ${z = f(g(x,y))}$ is continuous at ${(a,b)}$.

consequently, if ${f(u)}$ and ${g(x,y)}$ are each continuous on their domains, then so is ${f(g(x,y))}$

## Definition: Interior and Boundary Points
Let ${R}$ be a region in ${\mathbb{R}^2}$. An **interior point** ${P}$ of ${R}$ lies entirely within ${R}$, which means it is possible to find a disk centered at ${P}$ that contains only points of ${R}$

A **boundary point** ${Q}$ of ${R}$ lies on the edge of ${R}$ in the sense that *every* disk centered at ${Q}$ contains at least one point in ${R}$ and at least one point not in ${R}$

For example, let ${R}$ be the points in ${\mathbb{R}^2}$ satisfying ${x^2+y^2<9}$. The boundary points of ${R}$ lie on the circle ${x^2+y^2 = 9}$. The interior points lie inside that circle and satisfy ${x^2+y^2 < 9}$. Notice that the boundary points of a set need not lie in the set.

## Definition: Open and Closed Sets
A region is **open** if it consists entirely of interior points. A region is **closed** if it contains all its boundary points.
