## Equation of a Line

A **vector equation of the line** passing through the point ${P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)}$ in the direction of the vector ${{\bf v} = \langle a, b, c\rangle}$ is ${{\bf r} = {\bf r}_0 + t{\bf v}}$, or
$${\langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle + t\langle a, b, c\rangle \text{, for } -\infty < t < \infty}$$

Equivalently, the corresponding **parametric equations of the line** are
$${x = x_0 + at, y = y_0 + bt, z = z_0 + ct \text{, for } -\infty < t <  \infty}$$

### Examples from textbook section 13.5

Find both the parametric and vector equations of the specified line:

Given equations for two lines in space, There are **four** possibilities:

1. The lines are parallel and do not intersect: ![[Lines and Vectors 2024-01-17 17.24.31.excalidraw]]

2. The lines are parallel and do intersect (they're the same line): ![[Lines and Vectors 2024-01-17 17.27.54.excalidraw]]

3. The lines are "skew" (non-parallel and non-intersecting): ![[Lines and Vectors 2024-01-17 17.29.13.excalidraw]]

4. The lines are not parallel and intersect: ![[Lines and Vectors 2024-01-17 17.31.13.excalidraw]]

>[!question] (31)
>The pair of lines
${\vec{r}(t) = \langle 1, 3, 2\rangle + t \langle 6, -7, 1\rangle, \; \vec{R}(t) = \langle 10, 6, 14\rangle + s\langle 3, 1, 4\rangle}$ belongs to which of the four categories just discussed? If the lines intersect at one point, find it.

### The equation of a plane in a space

Suppose we know a point ${P_0}$ (with position vector ${\vec{r}_0}$) that's on the plane, and a vector ${\vec{n}}$ that's perpendicular (a.k.a. normal) to the plane:

![[Untitled 2024-01-16 08.45.01.excalidraw|800]]

## Definition: Plane in ${\mathbb{R}^3}$
Given a fixed point ${P_0}$ and a nonzero *normal vector* ${\bf n}$, the set of points ${P}$ in ${\mathbb{R}^3}$ for which ${\vec{P_0P}}$ is orthogonal to ${\bf n}$ is called a **plane**

## General Equation of a Plane in ${\mathbb{R_3}}$
The plane passing through the point ${P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)}$ with a nonzero normal vector ${{\bf n} = \langle a, b, c \rangle}$ is described by the equation
$${\begin{align} &a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0 \text{, or } ax + by + cz = d \text{, where } \\ \\ &d = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 \text{.} \end{align}}$$

## Definition: Parallel and Orthogonal Planes
Two distinct planes are **parallel** if their respective normal vectors are parallel (that is, the normal vectors are scalar multiples of each other). Two planes are **orthogonal** if their respective normal vectors are orthogonal (that is, the dot product of the normal vectors is zero).

>Intercepts:
>${3x-2(0)+0 = 6 \implies x = 2}$
>${3(0) - 2y + 0 = 6 \implies y = -3}$
