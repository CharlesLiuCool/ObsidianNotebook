Throughout this section, there's talk about
- **simple curves** (curve that does not cross itself)
- **closed curves** (curve that ends where it starts)
- **smooth curves** (one with no kinks in it)
- **piecewise-smooth curves** (smooth for parts)
- **connected regions** (for any two points in the region, there is a path on the region that connects those two)
- **simply connected regions** (connected region without a hole in it)
- **open regions** (region that contains none of its boundary points)

## Definition: Conservative Field

If ${\vec{F} = \nabla \varphi}$ at all points in an open region ${D}$ (in ${\mathbb{R}^2}$ or ${\mathbb{R}^3}$), then ${\vec{F}}$ is called a **conservative field** (or a gradient field) on ${D}$ (and ${\varphi}$ is the potential function for ${F}$ on ${D}$)

Question: How can we tell quickly whether a given ${F}$ is a conservative field (on some region ${D}$)?

Answer in 2-D: If ${\vec{F} = \langle P_{(x,y)}, Q_{(x,y)} \rangle}$, then
${\vec{F} = \nabla \varphi \implies \langle P, Q \rangle = \langle \varphi_x, \varphi_y \rangle}$

${P_y = Q_x = \varphi_{xy} = \varphi_{yx}}$

If ${\vec{F}}$ is a 3-D field, say ${\vec{F} = \langle P(x,y,z), Q(x,y,z), R(x,y,z) \rangle}$, then
${\vec{F} = \nabla \varphi \implies P = \varphi_x, Q = \varphi_y, R = \varphi_z}$, so ${P_y = Q_x, P_z = R_x, Q_z = R_y}$

>[!question] (27)
>Determine whether ${\vec{F} = \langle y+z, x+z, x+y \rangle}$ is conservative on ${\mathbb{R}^3}$. If it is, find a potential function.

>[!check]- Solution

>${P_z = R_z = 1}$
>${Q_z = R_y = 1}$
> 
> ${\vec{F}}$ is conservative on ${\mathbb{R}^3}$

So the given ${\vec{F}}$ is ${\nabla (xy + xz + yz)}$

## The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals

Suppose ${C}$ is ${\vec{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle}$, for ${a \le t \le b}$ and ${C}$ lies in a region where ${\vec{F} = \varphi(x,y,z)}$:

Then,

${\begin{align} \int\limits_C \vec{F} \cdot \vec{T} dA &= \int\limits_C \vec{F} \cdot \vec{r}'(t) dt \\ &= \int_a^b \langle \varphi_x, \varphi_y, \varphi_z \rangle \cdot \langle x'(t) , y'(t), z'(t) \rangle dt \\ \\&= \int_a^b \left(\dfrac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x} \cdot \dfrac{d x}{d t} + \dfrac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y} \cdot \dfrac{d y}{d t} + \dfrac{\partial \varphi}{\partial z}\cdot \dfrac{d z}{d t}\right)dt \\ & = \int_a^b \dfrac{d}{dt} (\varphi(x(t), y(t), z(t)))dt = \varphi(x(t), y(t), z(t)) \bigg|_{t=a}^{t=b} = \varphi(B) - \varphi(A) \end{align}}$

## Theorem 17.4 Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals
Let ${R}$ be a region in ${\mathbb{R}^2}$ or ${\mathbb{R}^3}$ and let ${\varphi}$ be a differentiable potential function defined on ${R}$. If ${{\bf F} = \nabla \varphi}$ (which means that ${\bf F}$ is conservative), then

$${\int\limits_C {\bf F} \cdot {\bf T}\,ds = \int\limits_C {\bf F} \cdot d{\bf r} = \varphi(B) - \varphi(A),}$$

for all points ${A}$ and ${B}$ in ${R}$ and all piecewise-smooth oriented curves ${C}$ in ${R}$ from ${A}$ to ${B}$

## Notation:

${\oint}$ means an integral over a closed region.

**Note:**
${\oint\limits_C \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r} = 0}$ always since a closed region ends where it starts.

>[!question] (47) 
>Evaluate ${\int\limits_C \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}}$, where ${\vec{F} = \langle x, y^2 \rangle}$ and ${C}$ is the triangle with vertices ${(1,0)}$, ${(0,1)}$, ${(0,-1)}$, oriented counterclockwise.

>[!check]- Solution
>${\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}(x) = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}(y^2) = 0}$, this curve is closed.
>
>So ${\oint\limits_C \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = 0}$
