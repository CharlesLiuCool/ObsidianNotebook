Last Time:
We were graphing 3D surfaces using traces. We're studying mainly cylindrical surfaces and *quadric surfaces*, which will (for us) be of the form

$${Ax^2+By^2+Cz^2+Dx+Ey+Fz+G = 0}$$

Where A, B, C are not all zero

We already graph ${x^2 + 2z^2 + y = 4}$:
Traces ${y = k}$ are ${x^2 + 2z^2 = 4 - k}$,
which are: ![[4. 2024-01-23 08.14.48.excalidraw]]

>a) Find x,y, and z-intercepts,
>b) Find trace in each coordinate plane,
>c) then graph:
> $${\dfrac{x^2}{25} + \dfrac{y^2}{9} - z^2 = 1}$$

>[!check] Solution
>a) 
>x-intercept: ${\dfrac{x^2}{25} = 1 \implies x = \pm 5}$
>y-intercept: ${\dfrac{y^2}{9} = 1 \implies y = \pm 3}$

b) trace in yz plane is the trace for ${x = 0}$
$${\underbrace{\dfrac{y^2}{9} - z^2 = 1}_{\text{ a hyperbola}}}$$

The surface corresponding to an xyz equation can be shifted by replaing each x by (${x-a}$), each y by (${y - b}$), and/or each z by (${z - c}$)

>[!question] 13.6 (36) Identify & describe the surface:
>$${x^2 + y^2 + 4z^2 + 2x = 0}$$

>[!check]- Solution
> ${x^2 + y^2 + 4z^2 + 2x = (x+1)^2 - 1 + y^2 + 4z^2 = 0}$
> ${\implies (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + 4z^2 + 2x = 0}$

## 14.1 Space Curves (a.k.a. Vector Valued Functions)

![[4. 2024-01-23 08.36.56.excalidraw 1]]

A line is a space curve & a vector-valued function:

>[!question] 14.1 (9)
>Find a vector-valued function ${\vec{r}(t)}$ which describes the line through ${(2, 3, 7)}$ and ${(4, 6, 3)}$.

>[!check]- Solution
>${\vec{r}(t) = \langle 2, 3, 7 \rangle + \langle 2, 3, -4 \rangle t}$
>or ${\vec{r}(t) = \langle 2 + 2t, 3+3t, 7 - 4t \rangle}$


A non-line example:
>[!question] 
>Graph the space curve
$${\vec{r}(t) = \langle \dfrac{2}{\pi},\;2\sin(2t),\;2\cos(2t) \rangle,\;\;\;0 \leq t \leq 2\pi}$$

>[!check]- Solution
>${y^2 + z^2 = (2\sin(2t))^2 + (2\cos(2t))^2 = 4\sin^2(2t) + 4\cos^2(2t) }$
>${= 4 (\sin^2(2t) + \cos^2(2t)) = 4}$
>${\implies y^2 + z^2 = 4}$ (for all t)

We can define limits, continuity and domain for vector-valued functions:
- ${\vec{r}(t) = \langle f(t), g(t), h(t) \rangle}$ is continuous at ${t = a}$ if and only if ${f, g, h}$ are each continuous at ${t = a}$
- ${t = a}$ is in the domain of ${\vec{r}(t)}$ if and only if ${t = a}$ is in each of the domains of ${f, g, h}$.

>[!question] Example
>Consider ${\vec{r}(t) = \langle \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{t}}, e^{-t}, \dfrac{3t}{t - 2} \rangle}$. Find the domain of ${\vec{r}}$, discuss the continuity of ${\vec{r}}$, and find ${\lim_{t\to\infty} \vec{r}(t)}$
