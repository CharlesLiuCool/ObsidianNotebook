A **vector field** (of dimension ${n}$) is a function whose inputs & outputs are both ${n}$-dimensional.

*Examples:*
${\vec{F}(x,y,z) = \langle x^2 + y, xz, xy \rangle}$
3D input -> 3D output

${\vec{F}(x,y) = \langle x, -y \rangle}$
2D input -> 2D output

**Note:** The gradient of a function is always a field.
For ${f(x,y) = x^2 - xy^2 + 2y}$
${\nabla = \langle 2x-y^2, -2xy + 2 \rangle}$

In such a case, ${f}$ is called the *"potential function"* for its own gradient field.

>For ${\vec{F}(x,y) = \langle x,y \rangle}$ and the curve ${C = \{(x,y):x=1\}}$
>a) Determine the points on ${C}$ at which ${\vec{F}}$ is tangent to ${C}$.
>b) Determine the points on ${C}$ at which ${\vec{F}}$ is normal to ${C}$.
>c) Sketch ${C}$ and a few vectors on ${\vec{F}}$ on ${C}$.

>[!check]- Solution
>a) None, since on ${C}$, ${(x,y) = (1,y)}$, so ${\vec{F}(1,y) = \langle 1,y \rangle}$ <- never vertical
>b) ${(1,0)}$, Has to be on the curve ${(x,y) = (1,y)}$, and ${\vec{F}(x,y) = \vec{F}(1,y) = \langle 1,y \rangle = k \langle 1,0 \rangle}$ so ${1 = k}$, ${y = 0}$, Sp ${(x,y) = (1,0)}$
>c) Use your brain

>[!question] 48
>Find the gradient field ${\vec{F} = \nabla \varphi}$ for the potential function ${\varphi (x,y) = x + y}$. Sketch a few level curves of ${\varphi}$ and a few vectors of ${\vec{F}}$.

>[!check]- Solution
>${\nabla \varphi = \nabla (x+y) = \langle \varphi_x, \varphi_y \rangle = \langle 1, 1 \rangle}$

>[!tip] NOTE:
>Not every field is a gradient field.
>For example, there is no ${\varphi (x,y)}$ such that
>$${\varphi = \langle x,x \rangle}$$
>this would need ${\varphi_x = x}$ & ${\varphi_y = x}$
>(can use second derivative ${\varphi_{xy}}$ and ${\varphi_{yx}}$ to prove)
