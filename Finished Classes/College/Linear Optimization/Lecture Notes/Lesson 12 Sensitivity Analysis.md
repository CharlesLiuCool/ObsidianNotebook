The study of how an optimal solution ${(x^*,z^*)}$ depends on the problem parameters ${(A,b,c)}$

**Examples**
${1)}$ market value of a product changes
max profit -> change in ${c}$
${2)}$ product demand changes
supply constraint -> change ${b)}$
${3)}$ design constraint change
${4)}$ network alteration
${5)}$ uncertainties

**Example**
*Dakota Furniture Company Example*
\[Winston and Venkataramanan]

The Dakota Furniture Company manufactures desks, tables, and chairs. The manufacture of each type of furniture requires lumber and two types of skilled labor: finishing and carpentry. The amount of each resource needed to make each type of furniture is given in the table below. Also included are the available resource quantities and expected profit per item. Dakota believes that consumer demand is unlimited and would like a production strategy that maximizes profit.
