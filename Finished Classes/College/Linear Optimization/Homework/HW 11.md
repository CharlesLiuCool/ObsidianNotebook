Consider the LP

${\min\limits_x f(x) = x_1+2x_2+3x_3}$
${\begin{align} \text{s.t. }&x_1+x_2+x_3 = 3 \\ & x \ge 0 \\ &x \in \Bbb{R}^3\end{align}}$

**A.** Using a logarithmic barrier interior point approach, show that as ${\mu \to 0}$, ${x(\mu)}$  converges to the unique optimal solution.  \[You do not need to analytically solve for the central path.]

${\text{min } f(x) - \mu\sum\limits_{j=1}^3\log(x_j)}$

As ${\mu}$ goes to ${0}$, we get

${\min f(x)}$

so it just becomes the original problem. The solution of this is the unique optimal solution, so we are done.

___

**B.** Find the analytic center of the feasible region by carefully considering the limit ${\mu \to \infty}$.

Taking ${\mu \to \infty}$, the problem then becomes
${\min -\mu\sum\limits_{j=1}^3\log(x_j)}$
as ${f(x)}$ is no longer relevant (the ${\mu}$ portion simply is weighted much higher)

We can solve a problem with the equivalent solution

${\max \log(x_1x_2x_3)}$

This is minimized when ${x_j = 1}$ for ${j = 1,2,3}$. This satisfies the constraints as ${x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1+1+1 = 3}$, and ${x_1,x_2,x_3 \ge 0}$.

The intuition is that any value less than ${1}$ for ${x_j}$ would negatively contribute overall, and any value greater than ${1}$ forces at least one other value to be less than ${1}$.

Thus, the analytic center is ${(1,1,1)}$
