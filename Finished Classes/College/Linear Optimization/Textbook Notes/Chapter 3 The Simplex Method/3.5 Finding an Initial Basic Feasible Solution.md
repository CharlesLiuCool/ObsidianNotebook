>Finding an initial basic feasible solution

Sometimes, finding an initial basic feasible solution is pretty <u> straightforward</u>.

For instance, take a problem with the constraints 
$${Ax \le b}$$
$${b \ge 0}$$

We can introduce slack variables ${s}$ and get
$${Ax + s = b}$$

The vector ${(x,s)}$ defined by ${x = 0}$ and ${s=b}$ is a basic feasible solution and the corresponding basis matrix is the identity.

In general, however, finding an initial basic feasible solution is <u> not easy </u>.

### **Auxiliary Problem**

We can introduce an auxiliary problem which will give us a initial basic feasible solution or tell us if it doesn't exist.

Consider the problem

$${\begin{align} \text{minimize } c^T&x \\ \text{subject to } A&x = b \\ &x \ge 0\end{align}}$$

*Notes:*
We can always write the constraints into ${b \ge 0}$, possibly by multiplying some equality constraints by ${-1}$.

We can introduce a vector ${y \in \Bbb{R}^m}$ of *artificial variables* and use the simplex method to solve the auxiliary problem

$${\begin{align} \text{minimize } \;\;\;\;y_1\,+\,&y_2\,+\, ...\,+ \,y_m \\ \text{subject to } \;\;\;Ax\,+\,&y = b \\ &x \ge 0 \\ &y \ge 0 \end{align}}$$
