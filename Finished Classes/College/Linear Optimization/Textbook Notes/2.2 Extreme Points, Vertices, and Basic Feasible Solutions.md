>**Definition 2.6** Let ${P}$ be a polyhedron. A vector ${x \in P}$ is an *extreme point* of ${P}$ if we cannot find two vectors ${y,z \in P}$ both different from ${x}$, and a scalar ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$, such that ${x = \lambda y + (1-\lambda)z}$

*Notes:* In other words, a vector ${x}$ is an extreme point if it can not be expressed as a convex combination of two other elements in the polyhedron ${P}$.

>**Definition 2.7** Let ${P}$ be a polyhedron. A vector ${x \in P}$ is a *vertex* of ${P}$ if there exists some ${c^Tx < c^Ty}$ for all ${y}$ satisfying ${y \in P}$ and ${y \neq x}$.

*Notes:* In other words, a vector ${x}$ is a vertex of ${P}$ if the entirety of ${P}$ lies on a halfspace that goes through ${x}$.

>**Definition 2.8** If a vector ${x^*}$ satisfies ${a_i^Tx^* = b_i}$ for some ${i}$ in ${M_1, M_2,}$ or ${M_3}$ we say that the corresponding constraint is *active* or *binding*.

*Notes:* In other words, if a vector ${x}$ satisfies an equality constraint, then the constraint involved is active/binding.

>**Theorem 2.2** Let ${x^*}$ be an element of ${\Bbb{R}^n}$ and let ${I = \{i \,|\,a_i^{T}x^* = b\}}$ be the set of indices of constraints that are active at ${x^*}$. Then the following are equivalent:
>
>*a)* There exists ${n}$ vectors in the set ${\{a_i \,|\, i \in I\}}$ which are linearly independent.
>
>*b)* The span of the vectors ${a_i}$, ${i \in I}$, is all of ${\Bbb{R}^n}$, that is, every element of ${\Bbb{R}^n}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors ${a_i, i \in I}$
>
>*c)* The system of equations ${a_i^{T}x = b, i \in I}$, has a unique solution.

>**Definition 2.9** Consider a polyhedron ${P}$ defined by linear equality and inequality constraints, and let ${x^*}$ be an element of ${\Bbb{R}^n}$
>
>*a)* The vector ${x^*}$ is a *basic solution* if:
>(i) All equality constraints are active;
>(ii) Out of the constraints that are active at ${x^*}$, there are ${n}$ of them that are linearly independent.
>
>*b)* If ${x^*}$ is a basic solution that satisfies all of the constraints, we say that it is a *basic feasible solution*.
