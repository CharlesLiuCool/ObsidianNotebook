>**Theorem 2.4** Consider the constraints ${Ax = b}$ and ${x \ge 0}$ and assume that the ${m \times n}$ matrix ${A}$ has linearly independent rows. A vector ${x \in \Bbb{R}^n}$ is a basic solution if and only if we have ${Ax = b}$, and there exists indices ${B(1), ... B(2)}$ such that:
>
>*a)* The columns ${A_{B(1)},...,A_{B(m)}}$ are linearly independent;
>
>*b)* If ${i \neq B(1),...,B(m)}$, then ${x_i = 0}$.
