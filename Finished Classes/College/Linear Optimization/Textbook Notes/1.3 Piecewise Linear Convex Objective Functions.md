>**Definition 1.1**
*a)* A function ${f: \Bbb{R}^n \to \Bbb{R}}$ is called *convex* if for every ${x,y \in \Bbb{R}^n}$ and every ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$, we have
$${f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda y)) \le \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda)f(y)}$$
*b)* A function ${f: \Bbb{R}^n \to \Bbb{R}}$ is called *concave* if for every ${x,y \in \Bbb{R}^n}$ and every ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$, we have
$${f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \ge \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)}$$

A function of the form
$${f(x) = a_0 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_ix_i}$$
where ${a_0,...a_n}$ are scalars, called an *affine* function, is both convex and concave.

A vector ${x}$ is a *local minimum* of ${f}$ if ${f(x) \le f(y)}$ for all ${y}$ in the vicinity of ${x}$.
${x}$ is a *global minimum* if ${f(x) \le f(y)}$ for all ${y}$.

Note: A convex function cannot have local minima that fail to be global minima.

>**Theorem 1.1** Let ${f_1,...f_m: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}}$ be convex functions. Then the function ${f}$ defined by ${f(x) = \max_{i=1...m} f(x)}$ is also convex.
