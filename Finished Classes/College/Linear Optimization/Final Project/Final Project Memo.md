To: `CrowdMark City Government`

Crowdmark City and neighboring cities have been hit with a category 5 Spaghettiquake and massive Sushinami, and our team at Optimizers Inc. has heard about CrowdMark City's plans to construct a warehouse and distribution facility to provide relief supplies to local residents. We are wholeheartedly supportive of this measure to protect citizens of CrowdMark City and will have our entire team working tirelessly to ensure supplies get to residents. 

To optimize the placement by minimizing distance while maximizing outreach, linear optimization is required. Optimizers Inc. is a veteran in the optimization industry. Dedicated to serving the community, we have been in the industry for over 4 months. We thank you for entrusting us with this task.

Below is a brief **workplan** including deadlines our team will follow.

For *Status Report 1*, due April 14th, our team will formulate and solve the emergency supply linear programming problem for one supply station, locating the best placement with just one supply station.

For *Status Report 2*, due April 21st, our team will formulate and solve the emergency supply linear programming problem for two or more supply stations, finding the best placements.

For the *Final Report*, due May 1st, our team will provide a detailed report adhering to the guidelines provided describing the entire process and solutions that have resulted.

We thank you again for trusting Optimizers Inc., and look forward to our partnership.
