## What is Political Culture?

Norms, values, beliefs, civic values, religion, informal rules

>[!question] Key Question
>Does Democracy require a *'democratic culture'*?

Almond and Verba 1963: how individuals think and feel about the political system.

### Political Culture Theory - Assumptions

- Posits existence of a relatively homogenous and durable culture.
	- From which people derive their political preferences
- Emphasis on consensus over conflict
	- Shared values and beliefs that form a common citizenry are reflected in the political system
- Politics as from the 'bottom up'
	- Shared beliefs and values of the people at large that create political systems
	- *NOT* the actions of political elites or other types of elites
- Therefore, theories of political culture tend to make specific claims about preferences
	- While rejecting. claims about power

### Political Culture Through the Ages

- Aeschylus, The Persians (472 BC):
	- Distinguished East and West, associates former with despotism, latter with democracy.
- Montesquieu, The Spirit of the laws (1748):
	- Divided political institutions into monarchies, despotisms, and republics (democracies)
- John Stuart Mill, Representative Government (1861)
	- "No one believes every people is capable of working every sort of institution"
	- Need for legislators to take account of "pre-existing habits and feelings" of the people when creating political institutions.

### Civic Culture

A cluster of attitudes that includes:
- The belief on the part of the individuals that they can influence political decisions
- Positive feelings toward the political system
- High levels of interpersonal trust
- Preferences for gradual societal change

### Religion and Democracy: Weber

- The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905)
	- Protestant emphasis on individual responsibility
	- Conducive to capitalism
	- Creates a bourgeoisie
		- i.e. a robust middle-class that help spur further economic development
		- (Industrialization, recall Inglehart)
	- Contrast to Catholicism
		- Emphasis on hierarchy (the Pope) as opposed to individual-reading and connection with God
			- See Martin Luther
		- Historical examples e.g. Spain and Italy

### Religion and Democracy: Fish

- Islam and Democracy (2002)
	- Muslim majority countries -> authoritarianism
- Why?
	- Muslim majority countries -> female subordination -> authoritarianism
- Evidence
	- 149 countries and "Freedom House scores"
	- Find that on average, Muslim majority countries (>50% of population) are more likely to be authoritarian
	- Look at other factors such as:
		- Look at other factors such as:
			- Lower female literacy scores, sex-ratio imbalances
- Why the link between religion and female subordination
	- Claim that these imbalances reflect in social relations within the family
	- And are reproduced above in political institutions
	- Unquestioned leadership of the father -> culture of domination and intolerance

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Political Culture Theories

- Strengths:
	- Bottom-up -> captures agency/power of citizens
	- Strength of contemporary nationalist movement/right wing populism
		- Desire for community ties in light of Bowling Alone?
	- Operationalization/measurement: some good survey Qs
		- And multiple ways of understand culture
- Weaknesses:
	- Assumption of homogeneity problematic?
	- Critique of Inglehart: selection bias of countries
		- Inglehart only focuses on industrial countries
		- Over-samples wealthy democracies
		- Missing later democracies
	- Haphazard/poor measurement
		- E.g. Huntington: hard-to-define mixture of ethnicity and language, and a residual category (Latin America)

### Political Institution Theories

- Overall, posit some congruence between elements of political institutions and other political outcomes.
- Institutions are the 'rules of the game' that are designed to coordinate behavior to achieve certain outcomes.
- Institutions aim to encourage certain types of behavior and punish violations.

>[!tip] Big Picture
>Institutions are humanly devised constraints that structure political economic and social reaction.

___

### Three Big Lessons

1. For every example of institutions that work in the way intended by their designers, there are plenty of other examples that do not work as intended.
2. Sometimes when institutions work, it is because they reflect the underlying balance of power.
3. Pay attention to the origins of institutions because they may reflect strategic decisions by powerful actors.

### Elections and Electoral Laws

- Why so important?
	- Probably THE most or at the very least one of the clearest indicators of a democracy
	- The bare minimum
- Not always true, nuances:
	- Some authoritarian regimes use elections, but these are usually rigged/manipulated in some way
- Electoral system
	- A system of rules that outline how elections will be conducted
	- Three main types:
		- Majoritarian
		- Proportional
		- Mixed
	- In reality: a great deal of variation

>[!tip] Important
> Be aware of what kinds of incentives electoral systems generate

### Two Key Concepts

Accountability
- Holding politicians, political parties, and governments accountable
	- i.e. how to punish/reward at the next election
Representation
- To what extent the government/parliament/etc. most fairly and accurately represents a wide variety of people and opinions within a polity.

### Majoritarian Electoral System

- Seats in legislature allocated by territorial-based districts or constituencies
- Whoever receives the most votes wins
	- Majority systems
	- Plurality systems
		- E.g. four parties in a district
			- A: 35% of the vote
			- B: 25% of the vote
			- C: 22% of the vote
			- D: 18% of the vote
		- A wins, despite only having 35% of the vote, becomes the national representative.
		- The system is therefore majoritarian in the sense that it tends to produces outcomes in which the largest party wins a majority.

#### Majoritarian Type #1: SMD

"Single-member districts"
- Plurality systems
	- E.g. UK, US, Canada, India, and Nigeria
- Just need to win the plurality of votes within a system

Strengths?
- Simplicity. One representative accountable to the district.

Weakness?
- Unrepresentative outcomes likely, at local and national level.

#### Majoritarian Type #2: SNTV

"Single nontransferable vote"
- Similar to SMDs but multiple candidates in a district
- E.g. three seats: top three are elected
- Much less frequent: Afghanistan, Japan up until 1994, Taiwan up until 2005

Strengths?
- More representative, whilst maintaining some (although not as much accountability)

Weaknesses?
- Can encourage intraparty fighting:
- Candidates from the same party standing against one another (as opposed to one candidate per party under SMD)

#### Majoritarian Type #3: AV

"Alternative vote"
- Absolute majority, *NOT* plurality
- Rank order candidates e.g. 1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice etc.
- If no candidate wins 50%, the bottom candidate is eliminated, and their respective voters' 2nd choices are reallocated... etc., until there is a winner.

Strengths?
- Still only candidate per district, so high accountability
- Voters can express several preferences, and have a better shot at their second preferred candidate getting in, if the first fails

Weaknesses?
- Complicated? Requires a great deal of information for voters to know about all of the parties candidates, beyond their top preferred one.

#### Majoritarian Type #4: Runoff Two-Round System

Most common way of electing presidents around the world.
- First round of voting -> top two candidates go through to a second round

Strengths?
- First round tends to have a lot of parties: citizens can express lots of preferences

Weaknesses?
- Might still be forced to vote for undesirable candidate in the second round.
- Significant costs

### Proportional (PR) Electoral Systems

- Again, lots of variation, but general goal is more or less, if a party wins 10% of the vote, it should receive around 10% of the seats.
- *ALL* have multimember districts
	- Although district size differs (we will look at this in a moment)
- *ALL* use some kind of quota/divisor to determine who exactly is elected

Strengths?
- More proportional. Better for overall representation.

Weaknesses?
- Small extremist parties. Government formation (coalition-building) can be problematic.

### PR Factor #2: District Magnitude

- The most important factor influencing the proportionality of a system.
- How many representatives per district
- Larger magnitude: more proportional
	- Can even vary within systems
	- E.g. Spain: Largest districts (Madrid and Barcelona) = 37 and 32
		- Smallest districts (Soria, Castilla y Leon) = 2
	- The whole country could be one huge district
		- E.g. Netherlands with 150 seats, so each candidate needs to get 1/150 votes to get a seat.

### PR Factor #3: Electoral Thresholds

- A minimum % of votes a party/candidate must win before they can get a seat
	- E.g. Germany: 5%
	- Israel: 3.25%
	- Turkey: 10%
- To discourage smaller, extremist parties and party system fragmentation

### To Think About

- More broadly: institutions vs. culture in determining outcomes?
- For you, is there a perfect mix of accountability/representation?
- Which one is the most important for you?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of different systems?

Remember one of the question options for your country case portfolio asks you discuss your chosen countries' electoral systems.

**Malapportionment**: imbalance in allocating seats to different districts.

There are strategic choices involved in the shaping of institutions. 

**Gerrymandering**: redefining districts in irregular shapes to benefit a particular party.
