### Once Again, Theories of Political Institutions Say

- Two-party systems vs. multiparty systems
	- Tightly connected to parliamentary/presidential systems
	- AND electoral system

### Defining a Political Party

- Group of (somewhat) like-minded individuals who want to attain formal political power in office
	- Distinguish to informal power: e.g. a social movement, a protest group
	- Also distinguished from interest groups
- Therefore, political parties are a form of professionalization:
	- Turn citizens into political elites who know the ins-and-outs of policy proposals, policy making, and so on
- Provide links between rulers and the ruled: the political elites and citizens
- Invaluable for healthy democracies

Ambitious political candidate would have no incentive to create a organization that would be a benefit to so many other candidates. 

### The Importance of Political Parties

- Organizing people and ideas
- Driver of political participation
	- European context - party membership usually much higher
- A big say in determining the policy agenda
- In the European context, even small parties can have a big impact
	- "The permissiveness" of electoral systems in most European countries
	- Proportional representation

### Themes for Consideration

- What drives formation and success of political parties?
- Two approaches:
	- Bottom-up: Social cleavages, changes/dynamics within citizens and the electorate
	- Top-down:
	1. Party strategy party elites shaping success, selling their party to the masses, strategically altering party positions and platform to gain favor (and ultimately, votes)
	2. Institutions (electoral institutions and laws primarily)
		- Incentives differ from electoral system to electoral system
			- Can new parties break through? Or work within current system?
	- Main focus for today: social cleavages and institutions
- Variation in organization of parties and party systems:
	- Coalition-building
		- Multiparty systems: parties will probably have to make compromises
		- Two-party systems: debate/coalition building goes on BEFORE running for office e.g. primaries.
			- Although: this can actually weaken parties - direct appeals from one person to the electorate (recall Linz and the perils of presidentialism)

### So, Key question in broader context of political institutions

**Do institutions or social cleavages matter more for political party formation and success?**

- Contrast to theories of political culture (we've already seen) and political economy (coming next week)
- Bottom-up view: not quite culture, but linked
- Top-down view: parties strategically alter outcomes

### Defining "Party System"

- Most common:
	- Two-party systems
		- Only two parties have a realistic chance
		- US a classic example
		- Also UK, but some variation here
		- Again, tightly linked to type of electoral system: majoritarian/plurality focused
	- Multiparty systems
		- Multiple parties have a realistic chance of holding power
		- Most democracies have multiparty systems
		- Coalition building
- Less common but still important
	- Non-partisan system e.g. small islands such as Micronesia and Tuvalu
		- Absence of political parties
		- Unicameral legislature of Nebraska is non-partisan
	- Single-party system
		- Only one party allowed to hold power - so, authoritarian
			- China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam
	- One party dominant system
		- In theory, multiple parties exist but only one has realistic chance of power
		- Again, common in authoritarian regimes
		- But also, Japan and Liberal Party 1955-1993

### Effective Number of Parties Calculation

${= \dfrac{1}{v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2+v_4^2}}$
${v:}$ percentage of votes

### Institutions: Duverger's Law

- Single-ballot majoritarian -> two-party
	- Small parties disincentivized from formation (difficult to win seats)
		- And voters don't want to throw away their  votes for party that has no real chance
	- So rally around one of the top two who is most likely to win
- Contrast to proportional systems -> multiparty
	- Small parties have small threshold to win seats
	- Citizens can vote less strategically and more "with their hearts"
- AND majoritarian with run-off systems -> multiparty

### Social Cleavages Theory

Huge societal change -> shift in social divisions -> collective identities form -> organizations form -> political parties emerge -> party system "freezes"

### Four Main Cleavages in Europe

Impact of the development of the nation state

- State vs. church (religiosity)
	- Most evident in Christian Democrat parties
	- But a key issue for other parties that might not have "Christian" in their name
- Center vs. periphery (territorial)
	- Some states better than others at assimilating other cultures into the majority nation
	- Tensions between elites in central administrative areas and those in more outlying areas
	- Usually expressed in terms of regional nationalism

### Four Main Cleavages in Europe

Impact of the industrial revolution
- Owner vs worker (class)
	- Left and the right
	- Mostly economical conflict
- Land vs. Industry (urban/rural)
	- Tension between industrial and agricultural sectors on trade policies such as continued exercise of control over tariffs
	- Some agrarian/peasant parties e.g. Finnish Centre Party, Polish Peasants People's Party

### More on the Class Cleavage

- Industrial revolution
	- Workers vs. capitalists
	- Proletariat vs. property-owning bourgeoisie
	- Also peasants vs. large landowners
- Redistribution (centralized economy) vs, free market and smaller state
- This is the foundation of left-right divide across many countries today

### Now: The Post-material Cleavage

What was the "silent revolution"?

Post-WWII:
- High levels of existential security -> intergenerational value shift
- Erosion of materialist values
- Rise of post-materialist values prioritizing individual free choice and self-expression

...this is eventually expressed in political outcomes.

### What are "Materialist Values"?

Meeting basic needs, e.g.:
- Security
- Sustenance
- Shelter
	- For a long time, it was hard to meet needs
	- Don't have time to contemplate big life questions

### What are "Post-materialist" Values

- Freedom of Speech
- Gender Equality, race, LGBTQ+
- Environmentalism
- Citizen input and political participation
- "Individual improvement"

Generation effect: those born under more economic scarcity place a high value on meeting material needs and safety needs.

Those born after are more likely to value post-materialist values.

### College Education and Urbanization

- Education effects:
	- More exposure to different backgrounds, cultures, etc.
	- May speak more languages, take new classes
	- Also, more women in education compared to immediately post WWII
	- Therefore: higher "tolerance"
- Urbanization effects:
	- Situated in cosmopolitan centers, many different cultures, race, ethnicity
	- Combined with "success" of cities, more opportunities, higher salaries, etc.
	- embrace multiculturalism, socially liberal values

### In contrast...

"Insecurity encourages an authoritarian xenophobic reaction in which people close ranks behind strong leaders, with strong in-group solidarity, rejection of outsiders, and rigid conformity to group norms" - Inglehart

### Effects of Post-material Cleavage on Politics?

Inglehart and Norman's Argument: Older cohorts more likely to vote for authoritarian, populist movements/parties/leaders

On the other hand, younger generations are more likely to vote for status quo politicians
