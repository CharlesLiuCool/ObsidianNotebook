### From Nationalism and Citizenship Towards Democratic Transitions: Social Movements

Beyond nationalism and citizenship, projects of legibility and the increasing weight of the state on society had unintended consequences: they gave rise to social movements.

### Contentious Politics

To this point, we have spoken exclusively about elites and the ruling class.

Ordinary people engage in contentious politics:
- ordinary people confront elites and authorities
- power based on numbers - collective action
- pre-modern contentious politics were almost always local ephemeral, and non-institutionalized

Over time, projects of legibility and the emergence of nationalism and citizenship would give rise to new forms of contentious politics: social movements.

### What Do All These Movements Have in Common?

- Broad-based collective action by ordinary citizens
- Aimed at national-level politics
- Efforts to hold state accountable

### Modern Social Movements

In contrast to pre-modern forms of contentious politics - local, ephemeral, and non-institutionalized - modern social movements are:

- Broad-based collective changes, built on common purposes and social solidarities, in sustained interaction with authorities, elites, and opponents, often working through complex organizations.

### Two Big Questions

Origins of social movements: how do social movements overcome the collective action problem?
- Political reforms due to pressure from below are public goods: how to do ordinary people overcome the free-rider problem?
- Consequences of social movements: specifically, what role do they play in democratic transitions?

### The Big Picture: The Origins of Early Electoral Democracies

![[Origins of Early Electoral Democracies.png]]

### State Building, Social Movements, and Citizenship

- By the late 18th century, tax revolts were becoming sufficiently broad-based and well organized to generate national movements challenging elites and authorities
- Nationalism + tax revolts led to a continent-wide assault on aristocratic privilege
- In the late 18th century, a new relationship emerges between ruler and ruled: citizens and citizenship
- Citizen: new category of identity and persons defined exclusively by their legal attachment to the state, not by their status at birth.
- Citizenship: set of enforceable rights and obligations *shared uniformly among members of the nation*, creates ideas about political equality


### Democracy & Social Movements

"It was the late eighteenth-century that the form "democrat" came into use, for that was when social movements began to challenge existing social order in the name of democracy and Europeans and North Americans"

"The driving force for democratization often originated among those who challenged the elites: no history of democratization can neglect the marches, petition drives, strikes, insurrections, and other forms these challenges assumed"

- John Markoff, *When was Democracy Invented* p. 169

### The Long Century of Democracy

Democracy did not emerge fully-formed at one time from the new ideas and practices of nationalism, citizenship, and social movements.

### Outcomes

Late 18th, early to mid 19th century: emergence of liberal and republican movements, mostly spearheaded by new middle classes (lawyers, doctors, engineers, writers, journalists).

Seek limited forms of representation and constitutional government---government authority rooted in popular sovereignty, not dynastic legitimacy.

Early reformers often seek limited reforms and fear mass political participation.

1870-1920: democratic transitions across Europe.

Two major dimensions, both of which are necessary to consider a political regime democratic:
- establishment of parliamentary sovereignty
- transition to universal male suffrage
	- universal female suffrage will lag behind male suffrage by several decades

### Catalyst of Democratizing Reforms (and Sometimes Reaction): Working-class Politics

- 19th-century industrial revolution produces a new class: industrial labor, working under brutal conditions, averaging 61% of total workforce by 1910.
- New economic structure of factory production favored collective action
- Workers form associations of mutual assistance, out of which labor unions emerge, incorporating about one-tenth of labor by 1914.
- Parallel to worker collective actions, emergence of political parties representing workers, averaging one-fourth of all votes by 1914.

### Three Theorists of Capitalism, Social Movements, and Communism

- Karl Marx
- Vladmir Lenin
- Antonio Gramsci

"A spectre is haunting Europe. The spectre of communism"

"Let the ruling classes tremble at the Communistic revolution. The proleterians have nothing to lose but their chains. They hav a world to win. Workingmen of all countries unite!" - Karl Marx, *The Communist Manifesto*

"The spontaneous development of the working-class movement leads to its subordination to bourgeois. Hence, our task, the task of Social-Democracy, is to divert the working-class movement from this spontaneous, trade-unionist striving and to bring it under the wing of revolutionary Social Democracy." - Vladmir Lenin, *What is to be Done*

"The traditional ruling class, which has numerous trained cadres, changes men and programs and, with greater speed than is achieved by the subordinate classes, reabsorbs the control that was slipping form its grasp. Perhaps it may make sacrifices, and expose itself to an uncertain future by demagogic promises; but it retains power, reinforces it for the time being, and uses it to crush its adversary and disperse his leading cadres, who cannot be very numerous or highly trained." - Antonio Gramsci *Prison Notebooks*

### Marx and the Absence of Communist Revolutions in Capitalist Countries

Big mistake: he underestimated the infrastructural power of the state
More mistakes:
- Its hard for workers to come together
- he assumed states would all be allies to capitalists

- Marx and Engels predicted inevitable communist revolutions, brought about by the inexorable logic of capitalism
- It is safe to say that this prediction has not come true: orthodox Marxism has been falsified
- Marx believed that class contradictions made revolution inevitable; failed to consider the logic of collective action and the role of leaders, organizations, and culture.

### How Contemporary Social Scientists Think About Collective Action

- Strategic action and game theory: the logic of collective action organizations and resources
- Public goods characterized by: jointness of supply and non-excludability
- States, state strategies, and structures of political opportunity

Rational decision makers have no reason to supply goods to the public since people that did not contribute can benefit from it.

### The Problem of Collective Action

If we think of states as organizations that provide **public goods**, then collective action to form a social movement that challenges the state is also a public good plagued by the problem of *free-riding*

### The Prisoner's Dilemma

Estep reference?

### Musings

We need a theory to explain why collective action/social movements are relatively infrequent

The free-riding/prisoner's dilemma framework predicts that cooperation for collective goods should never happen --- it over estimates the problems of collective action.

The problem of free-riding explains why a player would not cooperate, given anticipation of how others will act; an alternative framework is based on mutual expectations: player 1 will cooperate if she believes that player 2 will cooperate (and player 2 reasons identically)

### An Assurance Game

Based on **mutual expectations**. If i expect you to protest, I will protest too. Protests occur if a sufficient number of players share these mutual expectations.

Outcomes are:

|    | Protest | Stay Home |
| --------- | ------- | --------- |
| P        |    2,2   | 0,0       |
| SH     |    0,0    |    1,1      |

### Emotions

Evidence exists that people will join social movements if they think the movement represents **justice**.
- Justice is a public good, but a particular kind
	- Invokes complex emotions like pride and self-identity as a "moral" person
But this still can't explain everything...plenty of people will stay home.

### Risk Aversion

- Some people are highly risk accepting: they will participate if they anticipate that a small number of others will participate.
- Others are highly risk averse: they will participate only if they anticipate larger number of co-participators.

### The Problem of Concealed Preferences

- Dictatorships can disrupt the formation of mutual expectations of collective action by fostering mutual mistrust (extensive security apparatus & demand that citizens publicly profess loyalty to regime)
- Players have incentives to conceal their true preferences, or dissimulate, making it difficult to judge the probability that others will act.
- This is a problem of **asymmetric information**

### Information Cascades & Dissent

- **Information cascade:** first the most risk-accepting people participate, and their participation gradually induces the more risk averse to participate, until even the most risk averse have joined in; crowds start small and may quickly swell to large sizes.
- - each person updates their expectations as private information becomes public information
- This is why outbursts of social movements can be unpredictable, and dictatorships are so keen to suppress any signs of dissent

### A Toy Model of Risk Threshold

Individual ${i}$ has a threshold, ${t_i}$, defined as the number of protesters, ${P}$, that ${i}$ must observe participating before joining collective protest action: ${i}$ participates if ${P > t_i}$

A risk profile, ${T}$, is just a collection of individual risk thresholds. Let's look at different possible risk profile in a population of five people.
1. ${T = \{0;1;2;2;2\}}$: all participate, because the first person is highly risk accepting.
2. ${T = \{1;1;2;2;2\}}$ none participate
3. ${T = \{0;1;2;3;4\}}$ all participate

Note that in the three scenarios, ${\bar{t} = 1.4;1.6;}$ and ${2.0}$, so mean level itself does not predict participation.

### Contingency & Surprise

- The risk aversion model is surely too simple, and it is simply not possible to gain access to the distribution of risk
- But if these speculations about preference concealment and information cascades are correct, then we have an appreciate of why revolutions like the Arab Spring take everyone, observers and participants, by surprise.
- It might be the case that we can explain after the fact, but we cannot predict

### Another Important Concept: Political Opportunity Structure

The way a country's political system, shapes, promotes, checks, or absorbs the challenges it confronts from organized civil society
The relative degree of openness or closure of a polity to new forms of contentious politics
Provides incentives and disincentives for collective mobilization: affects individuals' and leaders' beliefs about the likelihood for success


### Bringing This All Together...

Tarrow, *Social Movements and Contentious Politics*

- When do people engage in contentious politics?
	- Argument: when political opportunities increase, political constraints decrease, and create new opportunities via collective action, which are used by others in widening cycles of contention.
- But how does this collective action come about?
	- Tarrow's answer: depends on trust and cooperation between participants
		- This is generated by shared understandings and identities.

### Organization & Resources

Remember, the logic of collective action assumes that all benefits are public goods.

Organizations can provide private benefits to professional staff: leaders of social and revolutionary movements because political leaders who enjoy public and private benefits

Organizations cultivate ideologically committed cadres who are more risk-accepting and have utility functions that privilege collective outcomes.

### States and Social Movements

State strategy influences the formation, activities, and outcomes of social movement.

State repression can inhibit movement development, drive movements undergrounds, but may also catalyze violent response.

States can choose to accommodate social movements: this is more likely when ruling class is divided or external threats place a premium on social peace.

### Social Movements & European Democracy

Capitalist development shifted the balance of class power:
- Decrease the power of large landlords who benefit from extractive institutions
- Increased the power of working classes who are consistent advocates for inclusive economic and political institutions
	- Better working conditions
	- Universal franchise and parliamentary governments
- Urban middle classes straddle the divide: in general, prefer more inclusive economic and political institutions (rise of liberal movements advocating for private property, parliamentary supremacy, and secularism), but fearful of potentially radical workers.

### Capitalist Development and Democracy

As we've seen, a crucial causal link in our causal model is from *working-class collective action* to democracy.

- The literature on this topic makes two types of claims, typical of a political economic theory:
	- Capitalist development changes the **distribution of power in a society** so that pro-democratic groups gain power and anti-democratic groups lose power
	- Capitalist development changes the class structure: under industrial capitalism, there is a new class with **pro-democratic political preferences**.

### Capitalist Development Shifted the Balance of Class Power:

- Decreased the power of large landlords who benefit from extractive institutions
- Increased the power of working classes who are consistent advocates for inclusive economic and political institutions.
	- Better working conditions
	- Universal franchise and parliamentary governments
- Urban middle classes straddle the divide: in general, prefer more inclusive economic and political institutions (rise of liberal movements advocating for private property, parliamentary supremacy, and secularism), but fearful of potentially radical workers.

Increased industrialization -> increased chance of democratic transition

### New Class with Pro-democratic Political Preferences

Social movements are critical, but not the entire story.

Can't ignore the independent role of the bureaucratic state and the rule of law:
	- Autocratic rulers can no longer treat the state as their personal property: reduces their capacity to repress society
	- Emergence of middle-class public servants: belief in rule of law generates demand for constitutional rule
Emergence of middle professional class---doctors, lawyers, engineers, managers, teachers---as constituency for non-autocratic ruler

Professional politicians: view non-elite classes in society as potentially valuable political allies, push for suffrage expansion and political mobilization

### Towards a Broader Theory of Democratic Transitions

- Relative to Europe, the post-colonial world is much less wealthy. The post-colonial world did not experience a comparable commercial revolution---which means they didn't develop the same labor-based social movements
- If this is correct, we should see a particular pattern when we look at data on democratic transitions and democratic breakdowns
1. Wealth and democracy are positively related
2. The effect of economic growth (higher levels of wealth over time) on the probability democracy should differ between countries with inclusive economic institutions and countries with extractive economic institutions: therefore, we should see a strong relationship of income to democratic transition in earlier periods (1870-1920) but not in later periods (when post-colonial nations numerically dominate the data

### Income and Democracy, 1500-1995

![[Pasted image 20241029110936.png]]

### Early Democratic Transitions

Features:
- Competitive elections between two or more parties to fill executive and legislative offices
- Elections cause observable alternation in power

Early democracies have suffrage restrictions considered unacceptable today, especially restriction of franchise to white men

### Income & Democracy

- Given: a country is either **Autocratic** or **Democratic**; and also...
- Assumption: in every year, a country has a non-zero probability of a regime transition
- Observation: wealthy countries tend to be democratic, and poor countries tend to be autocratic (authoritarian, dictatorships, etc.)
There are two possible (and non-exclusive) interpretations of this relationship

Interpretation #1: As a country becomes wealthier, it is more likely to become a democracy.

Rising levels of wealth **directly increase the probability of a democratic transition** from an autocratic regime in one year to a democratic regime in the next year.

Interpretation #2: As a country becomes wealthier, it is not more likely to become a democracy; the probability of a democratic transition remains constant as wealth increases.

The probability in a given year of a democratic transition in **statistically independent** of the level of wealth.

However if a country becomes democratic for reasons other than growing level of wealth, then rising levels of wealth make it more likely that the country will remain democratic. Rising levels of wealth **cause a decrease in the probability of an autocratic transition or democratic breakdown**

### Transition Matrix

${A_t-1}$ authoritarian last year
${D_t}$ authoritarian this year

|       | A_t  | D_t  |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| A_t-1 | P_AA | P_AD |
| D_t-1 | P_DA | P_DD |


### Two Hypotheses

${h_1}$: rising income causes ${P_{AD}}$ to increase (equivalent: rising income causes ${P_{AA}}$ to decrease). Call this an *endogenous* version of modernization theory.

${h_2}$: rising income causes ${P_{DA}}$ to increase (equivalent: rising income causes ${P_{DD}}$ to increase). Call this an *exogenous* version of modernization theory.

### Boix & Stokes: Three Criticisms of P&L

- Dwindling numbers - very few observations of wealthy dictatorships
- Sample selection bias - pre-1950s
- Omitted variable bias

### Dwindling Numbers = High Uncertainty

- Our confidence in a statistical procedure is positively related to the square root of the sample size: all else equal, more information = less uncertainty = more confidence
- At lower levels of income, there are many autocratic country-years because there are many poor countries, most of which have not yet democratized: our confidence in our estimate of ${P_{AD}}$ should be correspondingly high.
- At higher levels of income, there are very few autocratic country-years because most wealthy countries are already democratic and so our confidence in the estimate of ${P_AD}$ should be corresponding low: just a single measurement error of chance event has enormous consequences for the estimated probability.

Looking at wealthy dictatorships
most are already democracies.

### Sampling Bias

- Sampling bias refers to inferences drawn from samples that are not representative of the larger population about which we wish to draw inferences---survivorship bias, for example.
- Observations that begin in 1950 do not observe early (1870-1920) democratic transitions in European countries and so underestimate the relationship of rising income to the probability of democratic transition
- The early democratizers may provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis, but we do not observe that evidence because their transitions occur prior to the starting date of the dataset.

### Omitted Variable Bias

Some countries will not exhibit the predicted relationship because:

- Oil, that may "artificially" prolong the duration of dictatorship (we will study this later)
- Soviet bloc countries prevented from democratic transition by force of arms

### Main Result

When we extend the coverage of the data to include observations starting in 1850:
- It appears that there is temporal heterogeneity in the relationship of income and the probability of democratic transition
- There is relatively constant relationship between the income and the probability of a democratic breakdown across all periods

### Putting It All Together: Early Transitions to Democracy

19th and early 20th century Europe had three essential features conducive to democratic transitions:
- Economic structures that favor collective action.
	- Collective action should be easier with shift to factory production
	- States under threat of constant warfare and that increasingly depend upon the acquiescence of citizens to pay taxes, serve in armed forces, and more generally comply with state regulations
	- Inclusive economic institutions that soften elite incentives to be anti-democratic.
		- Transitions from agrarian economies to industrial economies

### Transitions to Democracy: Brief Examples

- Early democratizers (Switzerland, England, France): mid-19th century transitions led by middle-class reformers. Labor is not yet highly organized and radicalized. Reformers see workers as valuable electoral allies and extend the franchise.
- Later democratizers (Germany): early 20th century, workers are far more radical and much better organized, genuine thread of socialist revolution. Transition follows conclusion of WWI. Democracy takes place amid political crisis, much more difficult transition, in which working-class organizations play a more prominent role.
- Interesting point: those countries that democratized prior to WWI remained democratic during the inter-war period; those countries that democratized after WWI suffered democratic breakdown in the inter-war period

### Why Democratic Transitions Would be More Difficult in the Post-Colonial World

The post-colonial world, in contrast:

- Persistence of extractive economic institutions that generate intransigently anti-democratic elite incentives.
- Economic structures that do not favor collective action (agriculture = dispersed workforces; exploitation of natural resources).
- States that are not under threat of constant warfare and that receive substantial political, economic, diplomatic, military support from Great Powers
	- Persistence of patrimonial state structures, low infrastructural power, high levels of corruption

### The Bottom Line

Relative to Europe, the post-colonial world may need a higher level of collective action to overcome elite intransigence---but has worse prospects for achieving it, ergo increasing the difficulty of securing a regime change.
