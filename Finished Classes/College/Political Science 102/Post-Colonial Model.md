### Recap: State Capacity

- Ability of the state to achieve its objectives, even against the resistance of non-state actors.
- **State capacity** varies along two dimensions: despotic power and infrastructural power
	- Despotic power: power to make decisions without consultation with non-state actors
	- Infrastructural power: the capacity of the state to implement its own 

### The Puzzle Continues: Why do Post-Colonial States Differ?

European state formation was a fight for survival in which most died.

Outside of Europe, it was Europeans who supervised the creation of modern states.

The rest of the world cannot simply duplicate the European experience.

### Crucial Difference

Absence of military or commercial revolutions in post-colonial states!

### The Puzzles Continues: Why do Post-Colonial States Differ?

- conflict was prevented by European intervention

### Global Economic Consequences of Initial State Formation: External Predation

- Military conquest of wealth: precious metals and spices.
- Production of lucrative crops (tobacco, cotton, sugar, coffee) using enslaved human beings as labor
- With onset of industrial revolution: control over territory as source of raw material for industry and as market for manufactured products

### Global Political Consequences of Initial State Formation

- Destruction of local, pre-modern political institutions
- Creation of imperial political structure: increasingly modern institutions (bureaucracy and military) that brutally exclude local populations
- Colonial legacy, facade of modern state institutions

### Post-Colonial States

- Cannot replicate European pattern of state building
	- European political hegemony largely pre-empts war-induced state building
	- European economic hegemony large pre-empts local commercial and industrial revolutions

### Consequences for Post-Colonial Infrastructural Power

On average, post-colonial states (in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and North Africa, and Asia) exercise substantially lower levels of infrastructural power, relative to states in Western Europe and settler-colonial states (North America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand).

### How do Weak Post-Colonial State Survives

- The same global dynamics that pre-empt potential emergence of powerful post-colonial states also intervenes to sustain weak states
- Given international system, there is no selection mechanism to remove weaker states
	- international norms of sovereignty dictate intervention to prevent military conquest and consolidation
	- international donors and lenders
	- sale of natural resources
	- international military assistance

### Dynamics of Weak States

- Induced dysfunctional dynamic: because post-colonial states rely for resources on international system, rulers have reduced need to bargain with population and to build stronger institution
- Reduced incentives for principals to hold agents accountable
- Result: high levels of corruption and weak states

### Punctual Equilibria

From our brief historical overview, we can observe two types of historical periods: periods of rapid institutional change (critical junctures) and longer periods of relatively stable equilibria (characterized by path dependency)
- pre-Neolithic revolution disrupted climate change
- Neolithic revolution: millennia of semi-sedentary agriculture
- Urban revolution made possible by alluvial agriculture
- Political revolution: emergence of territorial extensive empires but weak states.
- Rise of modern state, made possibly by military revolution (or perhaps Protestant reformation, commercial/capitalist revolution)

### Recap: States and Public Goods

- States can compel compliance and punish free-riding
- States can supply public goods more efficiently because of economies of scale
- The efficient provision of public goods like the protection of private property require high levels of infrastructural power to finance the state and to spend its revenues. 
	- States with high agency loss cannot provide public goods (or cannot provide them efficiently

### A Possible Model of State Capacity and Wealth

infrastructural power -> inclusive or extractive economic institutions -> levels of wealth

- Acemoglu & Robinson: inclusive economic institutions depend upon inclusive political institutions (political pluralism and centralized state)
- Weber: rise of modern state and elimination of pre-capitalist obstacles to capitalism
- Dincecco: growth of state capacity, growth of tax revenue, growth of wealth

### Adapting this Model for the Post-Colonial World

Given inherited legacy of weak states and extractive economic institutions

Predatory intermediate or developmental states -> inclusive or extractive economic institutions -> levels of wealth

- Acemoglu & Robinson: inherited legacies
- Evans: types of states and development
- Kohli: sources of variation in post-colonial states

### Post-Colonial Development

- Prediction #1: There will not be a direct replication of European experience because once Europe conquers the globe, the conditions of development has changed.
- Prediction #2: Long-term historical legacies of colonial/imperial rule and extractive institutions will have an observable causal effect on contemporary political institution and levels of wealth
- Prediction #3: Variations in contemporary national income can be traced to variations in state capacity.

### Europe Conquers the Global Economy

- Large-scale transfer of wealth to small number of European economies
- Primary instrument was force, often wielded by non-state actors with state-like characteristics
- Involved destruction

### Did Europe Become Wealthy Because of the Transfer of Wealth?

Diverse relationships between global extraction of wealth and local institutional innovation:
- England & France: wealth extraction and institutional innovation; early growth trajectory
- Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark: institutional innovation without major sources of external wealth extraction; early growth trajectory
- Spain & Portugal: wealth extraction without institutional innovation; long-term, low growth trajectory
- Italy: no wealth extraction, limited institutional innovation: long term low-growth trajectory.

### Were Polities In Asia, Africa, & Latin America on the Cusp of State Formation & Capitalist Development?

There is *nothing* culturally unique about Europe that explains long-term development

The pairing of exclusive political institutions and extractive economic institutions is a self-reinforcing equilibrium.

In Europe, that equilibrium was disrupted by the convergence of a commercial and a military revolution in a region without single imperial power.

There is no direct evidence of any parallel disruption of the self-reinforcing equilibrium outside of Europe, but once Europe intervenes, we cannot observe the counterfactual

### The Economic Legacy of the Colonialism in the 20th Century

Global division of labor in which
- Economies in the industrial **core** - primarily in Western Europe and North America - dominate production of manufactured goods, accumulate financial, technological, entrepreneurial and human capital.
- Economies in the **periphery** specialize in primary products (agriculture, mining), entrepreneurial and have extreme scarcity 

### Which Means Post-Colonial States Left Facing Unique & Challenging Set of Circumstances, e.g. Haiti

- Hard to reactivate economy, preserve independence, and create identity from divided
- End up in authoritarian nature
- Indebt to France ($20 billion in today's dollars)

### Three Broad Types of Post-Colonial States

Evans, Predatory, Developmental, and other Apparatuses (1989)
- Predatory
	- True to patrimonial tradition, control of the state apparatus is vested in a small group of personalistically interconnected individuals".
	- This makes "...the development of a bourgeoise oriented towards long-term profit-based productive investment almost an impossibility".
- Developmental:
	- Interventionism to spur industrial development, aiming to becoming competitive in international markets.
	- Begin with low-end manufacturing and cheap labor
	- Emphasis on rapid expansion of exports
- Intermediary
	- Lack of generalized meritocratic recruitment and hence political leaders try to create "pockets of efficiency" within the bureaucracy.

### Predatory States

- Legacy of colonial policies that consolidate power of local intermediaries ruling through personal authority
- At independence, neo-patrimonial rulers use state apparatus to extract personal wealth
	- Staff highest echelons of the state with loyal followers
- Absence of bureaucratic coherence, regularized administrative procedures, and rule of law
	- State apparatus, therefore, incapable of executing rudimentary development projects
- Weak states subsidized by international system (and, in some, exports of oils, diamonds, etc.)

### Predatory State Example: Nigeria (1970s-80s)

- Gains independence in 1960
	- Leading up to this, elites had consulted with the British on emerging industry and pressures for decolonization in the country
- These elites further secure their positions following independence
	- e.g. positions in government, business licenses, rights to running water, and electricity granted to elites' supporters
- Elites operate outside the law: subdue any dissident minority

### Developmental States aka the "East Asian Miracle"

- Coherent, meritocratic bureaucracy -> high levels of infrastructural power
- Bureaucratic autonomy: efforts to minimize intervention by political or business elites in policy-making
- *Embedded autonomy*: complex relationship of interdependence and cooperation between autonomous and highly capable bureaucracy and private corporations.

### Development State Example: South Korea (1960s-Now)

- Coup 1961: political/economic instability
- Focus on exports: protectionist against imports
- Role of chaebols: family conglomerates
- Begin with lower quality goods, then with more money, focus on high end consumer goods e.g. Samsung, Hyundai, LG
- As country GDP grows, governmental interventionist policies decline

### Conditions for developmental states

... are very limited. Some particular conditions paved the way for the East Asian Miracle:

- Distinct colonial experiences: Japanese colonialism in Korean and Taiwan paved the way for the transfer of the Japanese developmental state to former colonies.
- Land reform: remove powerful intermediaries between state and society, allows for stronger bureaucratic states.
- War and state building: tense security environment of East Asia produces stronger states
- Resource scarcity precludes reliance on wealth from mineral exports

### Intermediary States

- Intermediate levels of infrastructural power based on uneasy balance between developmentalism and corruption
- "Pockets of efficiency":
	- Specific agencies follow bureaucratic logic, but these effective agencies are surrounded by corruption and imperfectly protected from either political intervention or rent-seeking behavior by economic firms
- Therefore, professionally, executed 

### What Distinguishes These States

- Levels of infrastructural / despotic power!
- Somewhere like North Korea may have high despotic power
	- But little infrastructural power --- low incentives for economic growth and state development in the same way as Europe unfolded
- Predatory states still quite abundant in the world 
- Developmental states have managed to increase their infrastructural power rapidly
	- But again, according to very different path compared to Europe
- Intermediary states are... somewhere in the middle

### Questions to think about

- How did your countries centralize their state?
	- Did they follow European / Western trajectory e.g. military revolution?
	- Or do they fit into one of the three post-colonial categories?
		- Or...something different?
- But beyond this, broader implications/questions:
	- Environmental limitations, and limits to capitalist growth: we cannot possibly all follow the U.S./European model to state development and economic development
	- State power is not unbreakable: "great" empires do fall after all
		- New power vacuums: e.g. collapse of the British empire
		- Will 'the dependency curse' break?
	- BRICs and rise of new nations through different economic policies
