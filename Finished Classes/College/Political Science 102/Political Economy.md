### Key debates/ideas of Political Economy

Looking at the way political and economic processes influence/interfere with each other.

- Classic Modernization Theory
	- Societies pass through the same stages of economic development
	- Democracies are more likely to *emerge* as countries become more developed.
- The "Survival Story" (counterpoint)
	- Societies pass through the same stages of economic development
	- Democracies are more likely to *survive* as countries become more developed.

### Classic Modernization Theory

Economic development makes the emergence of democracy more likely.

Start with agrarian, feudalistic traditional simple society. 
As economics progress, we have more complex society.
Can't be in control of all the different factors, so have to delegate sectors which makes leader lose power, getting closer to democracy.

Transitions to democracy become more likely as income increases.
Regime transitions may or may not become less likely as countries become richer.

Przeworski and colleagues supplied data, higher GDP correlates with higher proportion democratic

### The "Survival Story"

- Economic development helps democracies *survive*... but it does not necessarily help them *emerge*.
- When lower quality of life, democracy more likely to have people trying to overthrow in favor for dictatorship.

Transitions to democracy are unaffected by increases in income.
Regime transitions become less likely as countries become richer.

### Development, Regime Transition, and Democratization

Looking at the data, there is more regime transitions to democracy at higher GDP, falsifying Survival Theory.

### Variants of Modernization Theories

- Classical Modernization Theory lacks a central causal mechanism
- Four variants
	- Structural changes
	- Natural resources
	- Foreign aid
	- Inequality

### Review

- Theories of political culture say:
	- There is a "congruence" between some features of culture and some features of politics
	- Values, norms, beliefs, opinions, tastes, desires, symbols can be a cause of political outcomes.
- Theories of political institutions say:
	- Institutions are the "rules of the game" that are designed to coordinate behavior to achieve certain outcomes.
	- Aim to encourage certain types of behavior and punish violations of these rules

### Theories of Political Economy Say...

- Behavior is the product of rational decision making to satisfy economic interests.
- Different types of ways of organizing the economy leads to different types of political organizations.
- Diverse interests produce political conflict because political institutions and policies have significant distributional consequences

1. All members of society possess some endowment that has economic value.

2. All members of society are rational decision makers who have an interest in maximizing economic value.

3. Because different individuals have different endowments, as different individuals try to maximize their endowments, they potentially come in conflict with each other.

4. Rational individuals recognize that control of policies/institutions is critical to maximizing their endowment value.

## Endowments

Amount/value of the stuff that a person has under their control.

## Rational Decision Making

Procedure by which a decision is based. Makes deliberate, intentional, and conscious choices between alternatives to choose the option by maximizing their status (utility).

Always prefer one or the other, or be utterly indifferent about choice.
(weak assumption, only used in very artificial context)

We demand, that if a third option considered, there must be a transitive relationship between the choices.

So you have a 1, 2, 3 ranking preference over the option.

## Conflict

Economic life means there's uneven endowments across everyone, so conflict will arise.

### Major Implication

Rational actors will care about who forms the government, what policies they pursue, and what institutions are in place because policies and institutions have distributive conflicts; they have influence over the returns we get on our endowments,

If benefits of complying with the rule are higher than the cost, they will try to comply but maybe they'll cheat.

If benefits of complying are lower than the cost of changing them, actors may try to alter the institutions.

### What Happens when Political Economy meets Political Institutions?

Acemoglu & Robinson
- Inclusive versus Extractive Economic Institutions
	- Inclusive = pluralistic and centralized
		- Power is distributed broadly
		- The state enforces law and order, provides public services, and regulate economic activities
	- Exclusive = absolutists and decentralized
		- Power is narrow and unconstrained
		- The central state has little control over law and order, public services, and economic system

Credible Commitment Problem:
People tend to default on their promises if there is no reason to follow through on them.

### The Two Koreas

- North and South Korea experiences a bifurcated economic trajectory after the end of the Korean War
	- Crucially, both are initially managed by authoritarian governments
- South Korea recognizes private property rights and heavily invests in various firms and industries
	- They also invest in education, achieving high rates of literacy and schooling
- North Korea outlaws private property and pluralistic market
	- Education is propaganda first and foremost if at all

- South Korea fully transitions to inclusive economic institutions and democracy in the 1980s
	- A & R "The economic elite had little to gain from their own or the military's dominance of politics"
	- "Equality of income in South Korea also meant that the elite had less to fear from pluralism and democracy"

### Critiques of Political Economy Approaches

- Modernization theory still in dispute
	- Variants gaining more popularity
- Other contemporary examples, especially China: stronger economy, but not necessarily democratic.
- Class conflict? -> what about "culture wars", nationalistic populism
	- Political and economic institutions can mitigate conflict of interests
		- e.g. again perhaps China
		- Or even USA: highly unequal society (economically), yet other issues motivate voters
