### Housekeeping

- Today: continue political institutions
	- Parliamentary and presidential systems (and semi-presidential systems)
		- Introduction and examples
		- Mutual dependence/independence
		- Coalition building in governments
		- Presidentialism and democratic breakdown?
		- Broader consideration of pros and cons of each system

### Quick Review

- Overall, posits some congruence between elements of political institution and other political outcomes.
- Institutions are the 'rules of the game' that are designed to coordinate behavior to achieve certain outcomes.
- Institutions aim to encourage certain types of behavior and punish violations.

### Key debates/ideas on Presidential vs. Parliamentary Systems

- Degree of survival
	- Often argued that parliamentary regimes more likely to survive (Linz's argument "*The Perils of Presidentialism*")
	- Tendency for different constitution frameworks to produce legislative majorities
		- In presidential democracies the executive's party enjoyed legislative majorities 48% of the time
		- In parliamentary democracies had majorities at least 83% of the time
	- Duration and reappointment of cabinet ministers
		- "Return ratio" of cabinet minister in parliamentary regimes is about three times higher

### Presidential Systems

- Most common systems throughout the Americas
- President as head of state
- Emphasis on separation of powers

### Parliamentary Systems

- Executive and legislature linked: former derives legitimacy from the latter
- Head of state usually different to head of government
- Most common in Europe and throughout the Caribbean

### President Systems: Mutual Independence

- Electorate select chief executive and then independently selects members of legislature
- A presidential democracy is therefore a system of mutual independence of executive and legislature
- So: no quick institution solutions to moments of political crisis
- Chief executive also has the capacity to dissolve legislature and call for new elections

### Parliamentary Systems: Mutual Dependence

- Electoral selects member of parliament and then MPs select an individual as head of government and chief executive (Prime Minister)
- Legislature can dismiss government through vote of no confidence
- Chief executive also has the capacity to dissolve legislature

### Coalitions

- Especially common in parliamentary systems, particularly electoral systems of proportional representation
	- Multiple parties, emphasis on representativeness of broad variety of opinions amongst electorate
	- Many small parties can win seats in parliament
	- E.g. 80% of West European governments in parliamentary democracies formed with no single party controlling majority of seats
- So two or more parties must contribute members to the government to survive a vote of no confidence

### Juan Linz, The Perils of Presidentialism

- Presidentialism is more unstable than parliamentary systems
- Zero-sum elections:
	- "Presidentialism" is inescapably problematic because it operates according to the rule of "winner takes all" - an arrangement that tends to make democratic politics a zero-sum game, with all the potential for conflict.
- The style of presidential politics:
	- "The office of president is by nature two-dimensional and, in a sense, ambiguous: on the one hand, the president is the head of state and the representative of the entire nation: on the other hand, he stands for a clearly partisan political opinion"

### The Perils of Presidentialism, continued

- The problem of dual legitimacy:
	- "A presidential cabinet is less likely than its parliamentary counterpart to contain strong and independent-minded members - the officers of a president's cabinet hold their posts purely at the sufferance of their chief..."
	- Both a president and legislature can make a claim to legitimacy
- The issue of stability
	- "A prime minister who becomes embroiled in scandal or loses the allegiance of his party or majority coalition and whose continuance in office might provoke grave turmoil can be much more easily removed than a corrupt or highly unpopular president"

### Why should parliamentary regimes be more stable?

- Stepan and Skach (1993)
	- Mutual dependence should encourage *reconciliation* between executive and legislative branches
	- Mutual independence encourages *antagonism* -> leads to deadlock -> then may turn to the military to break stalemate
	- But in parliamentary regimes there are votes of no confidence, and/ore PM can dissolve parliament and call for new election

### However, important to consider other factors

- Cheibub (2007)
	- Three important findings:
	1. Parliamentary regimes tend to be richer to begin with:
	2. Small country is more likely to be parliamentary
	3. Legacy of military dictatorship matters

### Parliamentary Regimes

**Pros:**
- Faster and easier to pass legislative
- Can be more beneficial to countries with a population that is divided racially, ethnically, or ideologically (PM does not have as much influence as a president)
- Easy to form new parties
- Minimizes political polarization
- Often requires the formation of coalitions. (Ensures no groups/special interests will be favored over the other

**Cons:**
- Only the legislature can vote for the head of state/PM but not the electorate.
- Coalitions and governments can be unstable, especially if they are minority governments.
- Lack of definite election calendar term limits can be abused (Holding elections when it is in the governing party's best interests).

Electoral system -> gaining power
Political system -> what they do with that power

### Presidential Regimes

**Pros:**
- President is directly elected by the people
- Checks and balances as a result of separation of powers
- If a president has strong powers they can act quickly
- Presidents have a fixed term - providing more stability than PMs which can be removed at any time.

**Cons:**
- Potential for gridlock between the two powers.
- May be a disadvantage not be able to remove a president early.
- Perils of presidentialism? Tendency to authoritarianism due to increased polarization
