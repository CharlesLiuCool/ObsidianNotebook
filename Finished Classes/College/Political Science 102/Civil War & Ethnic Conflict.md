 ### Civil War

Persistent armed conflict between government and one or more armed and organized groups that results in a rupture of sovereignty in which the state loses uncontested control over some portion of its territory and population.

### Three Explanations for Civil Wars

- Opportunity, greed, and grievance
- Income as measure, and three hypotheses:
    
    - As a proxy measure of **state capacity (opportunity/institutions)**
        
        - Civil wars occur when the state is weak and cannot effectively police its own territory and population
        - As a proxy measure of opportunity **costs (greed/economy)**
            
            - Civil wars occur in the presence of valuable economic resources that can be controlled by opportunistic armed groups or secessionist movements
            
        - As a direct of **economic hardship (grievance/economy)**
            
            - Civil wars occur when extractive economic institutions cause economic distress and exploitation
            
        
    

### Opportunity: Fearon & Laitin

- Civil wars do not reflect grievances; especially not the ethnic grievances which appeared to be very important in many civil wars that erupted after the end of the cold war.
- Given a constant background state of grievance, civil wars reflect opportunities: aggrieved people join insurgencies when they judge the probability of successful repression to be relatively low.
- Civil wars reflect two conditions influencing the feasibility of insurgency
    
    - Infrastructurally weak states
        
        - Mountainous terrain

### Measuring State Capacity

- Civil wars do not reflect grievances; especially not the ethnic grievances which appeared to be very important in many civil wars that erupted after the end of the cold war.
- Given a constant background state of grievance, civil wars reflect opportunities: Aggrieved people join insurgencies when they judge the probability of successful repression to be relatively low.
- Civil wars reflect two conditions influencing the feasibility of insurgency.
- Infrastructurally weak states - Mountainous terrain (more places for insurgents to hide)

## Income & Opportunity Cost

**Opportunity Cost**: loss of potential gain from the next best alternative when one alternative is chosen.

### Greed

- Civil wars are more likely with greater lootable resources, especially oil
- Oil provides incentive to form rebel groups to capture oil rents control over oil resources finances rebel groups
	- But may also boost national income, which can deter insurgencies
- So, oil provides both motive and opportunity
- Therefore, we should see correlations between availability of lootable resources and profitability of civil war, particularly in low-income countries.

### Grievance: Economic Institutions, Inequality, and Civil War

Median voter theorem: under certain conditions, the median voter is a Condorcet winner.

Income distributions are **always** skewed to the right: the existence of a small number of extremely rich households pulls the distribution to the right and means that the mean will be higher than the median.

Therefore, the income of the median voter in a democracy will always be less than the average income; the median voter will be relatively poor. In an autocracy, on the other hand, the "median voter" is rich.

### Grievance: Boix, Civil Wars and Guerilla Warfare

Implications of the Median Voter Theorem
- The median voter in a democracy will therefore always (in theory) prefer high redistributive taxes that transfer income from rich to poor; while the median voter in an autocracy will prefer no taxes.
- Furthermore, the size of the redistributive taxation increases with income inequality: as income inequality increases, the gap between rich and poor increases and the median voter will make higher demands.

Some assets are relatively easy to tax; other assets are more difficult to tax.

Asset specificity: the extent to which capital can be moved abroad or not
- Land or oil wells = high specificity, low mobility
- High-level skills or liquid capital = low specificity, high mobility

Political violence should erupt as income inequality and asset specificity increases.

### Ethnic Conflict

"Conventional" wisdom: primordial cultures, irrational and ancient hatreds, such that given sociocultural heterogeneity, inter-ethnic conflict is a "natural" outcome
- Hurus vs Tutsis Rwanda
- Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, former Yugoslavia
- Africans v. Arabs, Sudan
- Shias v. Sunnis v Kurds, Iraq
- Jews v. Palestinians, Israel
- Turks v. Kurds, Turkey

### Ethno-Linguistic Fractionalized Index

ELF index = used by social scientists to measure the probability that two individuals selected at random from a given country are *NOT* members of the same ethnic group.

Closest we get to political culture argument is the ethnic conflict -> civil war stuff

### Selection Bias & Ethnic Conflict

- Be very cautious of enumerated examples of ethnic conflicts designed to "prove" that ethnic conflicts are ubiquitous and naturally occurring
Think of primordialist argument "people are always fighting with each other"
- Availability bias: a common cognitive bias in which availability of dramatic events leads naive observers to overestimate probability of analogous of events elsewhere or in the immediate future.
- This is a form of selection bias: we over-sample and hence over-estimate the occurrence of certain types of events.

### Frequency versus Likelihood

- A **list or count** of events - i.e., a list of events or conflicts - is uninformative about the likelihood of an event occurring.
- The probability of an event is defined as the number of times the event has occurred divided by the number of times it could have occurred; therefore, to avoid biased reasoning, you must know the demoninator
- P(Event) ${= \dfrac{\#E}{\#\omega} = }$ set of all possible events
- Remember: The probability of an event = the number of times 

### Likelihood of Violent Ethnic Conflict in Africa, 1960* - 1979

For a country with ${N}$ distinct ethnic groups, there are ${N \times (N-1)}$ inter-ethnic dyads and therefore ${\dfrac{N(N-1)}{2}}$ opportunities for an ethnic conflict event to occur in any given year. Calculate this number for all countries and multiply by all years.

### Contextualizing the Politics of Inter-ethnic Hostility

- Chew and Tumbuka: two Bantu-speaking people of eastern and central Africa.
- Split into citizens of two contemporary nations, Malawi and Zambia
- Border between Malawi and Zambia drawn arbitrarily by colonial authorities.
- Arbitrary border as **natural experiment**: good reason to believe that nothing systematically distinguishes Chew and Tumbuka on either side of the border, especially in villages on the border.

In Malawi, relations and culturally and politically antagonistic; In Zambia, the two groups view each other as ethnic brethren and political allies, with both supporting same political party.

### The Problem with Credible Commitment

- When an actor who makes a promise today has an incentive to renege upon it tomorrow
- In the case of civil war termination, both actors have an incentive to renege or any commitment
- If Party A disarms, Party B can also disarm or it can take advantage of A's vulnerability to win a decisive military victory
- The prisoner's dilemma - no incentive to cooperate
- Even though overall it may be rational, on the individual level it is not.

### Ethnic Conflict Solutions - Barbara Walter

- Why are domestic enemies unable to negotiate successfully?
	- And what can the international community do to help these conflicts?
- Four hypotheses:
	- Successful negotiations to end civil wars would vary directly with the strength of outside security guarantees
	- Opponents are increasingly likely to settle as the expected costs of achieving victory increased
	- The easier the stakes were to divide, the more likely opponents were to reach a settlement
	- The greater the skill of the mediator, the greater the likelihood for successful settlement.

### In Summary

- Three possible explanations for civil wars
	- Opportunity vs. resources/greed vs. asset-specificity and inequality/grievance
- Ethnic conflict is another dimension that often intersects with civil wars
	- But we need to be very careful about how much we might overstate the role of ethnicity in conflict.
- Solutions?
	- Possible with credible commitments, but these are hard
	- Credible commitments dependent on 
		- Outside security guarantees
		- Expected costs of victory
		- How to divide stakes
		- Skills of mediator involved

The more GDP per Capita you have, the probability you have a civil war goes steadily down.
