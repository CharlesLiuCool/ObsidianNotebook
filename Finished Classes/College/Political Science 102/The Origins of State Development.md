### The Modern State

- Extensive bureaucracies:
	- Civil servants
	- Hired based (partially) on competence and expertise
	- Paid a salary
	- Given specific spheres of authority
	- Bound by complex rules
- Capacity to tax and regulate economic activity
- Capacity to regulate large sphere of social life
- Claim to govern a population with a shared social identity - nations and nation-states

### The Novelty of the Modern State

- For most of human history, no states existed
- When states emerged comparatively recently, they were **patrimonial**, not bureaucratic
- Pre-modern states did not have extensive bureaucracies or the capacity to tax and regulate extensively
- The modern, bureaucratic, nation-state is a relatively recent innovation, dating approximately back to the French Revolution.

### The Non-ubiquity of the Modern, Bureaucratic Nation-state

- Contemporary states all claim to be modern, bureaucratic nation-states; but many states conform to this model only minimally
- The modern bureaucratic nation-state is observed only in some countries
- These countries tend to be wealthy democracies (not a coincidence)

### States

1. States are organizations whose control over military, political, economic and ideological resources allows them to claim ultimate authority; to issue commands binding on all other social organizations and groups.
2. Modern states exercise authority through expansive and permanent bureaucracies and claim to represent the nation
3. Prior to modern era, states exercised patrimonial authority - rules claimed ownership of the state as an extension of their household - over culturally heterogeneous societies that had no sense of common identity, few shared institutions, and many locally powerful intermediaries between rulers and the ruled.

### Some Questions

1. What are the initial origins of the state?
2. Why were pre-modern states patrimonial
3. What caused the transition to the modern nation-state? And why has that transition been uneven around the contemporary world?
4. What are the implications of the modern state for other important questions such as the origins of democracy or the causes of modern capitalist economies?

### Two Visions of the State

- As providers of goods and services valuable to society, especially protection of property
- As exploiters of society through predation.

Most states, in fact, are a mixture of protection and predation; the balance can shift over time and has very large consequences.

### Pre-Neolithic Revolution

- States do not exist either to provide protection or to be predatory on society
- For a state to exist, there must be economic surplus
- In hunter-gatherer societies, there is no economic surplus; and everybody; more or less, has the same factor endowment.
- Therefore, for states to exist, there must have been a prior shift in the distribution of factor endowments.

### Neolithic Revolution in the Zagros Mountains

- Climactic changes stimulate technological innovations and revolutionary shift from hunter-gathering in very small
- Communities to semi-settled agriculture that could sustain greater populations
- First five to seven thousand years: no permanent settlements or autonomous political institutions

### Urban Revolution Where the Tigris Meets the Euphrates

MESOPOTAMIA
- Fortifications, property deeds, and legal codes
- Priestly class and scribes
- But no autonomous political institutions:
	- governance through pre-existing religious and kinship institutions.

"Independent city states"

First time seeing economic stratification
Upper class lower class inequality.

### Imperial Revolution: Sargon the Conqueror & the First Territorially Extensive Empire, 23rd or 24th Centuries BCE

Sargon conquers Sumerian city states, first unified territorially-extensive empire.

The first set of explicitly political institutions claiming priority over all other economic, religious, and family-based institutions, with no function other than to rule a territory and its population.
- taxation
- permanent (but very small) bureaucracy
- specialists in coercion/cultural change
- standardized systems of weights and measures
- creation of imperial culture binding elites across the empire through written records and uniform education

### From Conquest to Administration

- How did Sargon administer his empire? This is a historical question
- How does the **logic of conquest** differ from the **logic of administration**? This is a theoretical question that lies at the heart of comparative politics.

### The Basic Problem of Rule Discovered by Sargon

The radius of conquest is larger than the radius of administration.

### Patrimonialism

Pre-modern rulers relied on traditions of paternal authority and extended family links to justify their control over kin and unrelated retainers.

Just as a patriarch could duplicate and transfer his authority to sons, so too could a pre-modern rule grant benefices to loyal followers, allowing them to claim authority.

But once granted such authority, agents of the ruler became quasi-autonomous local rulers and were difficult to control.

### Who Watches the Watchman?

The Roman poet Juvenal defined the core of the problem "Who can watch the watchmen?"

Qvis Cvstodiet Ipsos Cvstodes?

### Fallacy of the Minion

All villains have minions who serve their master faithfully and fully

### Principal-agent Relations and the Fallacy of the Minion

- Because people have limited time, energy, resources, talents, skills, and specialized training, we ask others to perform tasks on our behalf, an act called delegation.
- The principal in any relationship, is the person or persons (or organization) in whom authority originally resides.
- The agent is another person to whom the principal delegates his or her authority, authorizing the agent to act in her behalf.

### Agency Loss or Loss of Delegated Power

- Agency loss is the difference between the optimal outcome of delegation when the agency does exactly as the principal desires, and the actual consequence of delegation, when the agent may take actions that are not consist with the outcomes desired by the principal.
- When there is agency loss, the agent is doing something contrary to the wishes of the principal (including doing nothing: indolence or "slack" is a type of agency loss).
- Rulers - including mighty emperors - issue proclamations: but they cannot personally execute those proclamations

### Two Conditions Generating Agency Loss

1. Interest alignment: how much divergence exists between the interest of the agent and the interests of the principal? If they both want the same thing, there can be no agency lloss.
2. Information: how knowledgeable is the principal about the agent's action? If the agent cheats, will the principal know about it? This is the problem of asymmetric information.
- The agent should have complete information; he knows what he has done.
- The principal has only incomplete information.

### Information Asymmetries and Agency Loss

"The potential for mischief varies inversely with ones proximity to the authority figure." - the Simpsons

### Two Types of Power (and Ergo Ways to Minimize Agency Loss)

- Despotic power refers to the ruler's (or state's) ability to make decisions without consulting either subsidiary political elites or non-state actors.
	- The despot makes decisions unilaterally; but implementation requires delegation to agents and is therefore potentially undermined by agency loss.
	- Despotic states may be infrastructurally weak.
- Infrastructural power refers to the capacity of the ruler (state) to implement its decisions, elicit compliance from its population, and therefore achieve its objectives.

### The Autonomous Power of the State

Low despotic + low infrastructural coordination = feudal
Low despotic + high infrastructural = bureaucratic
High despotic + low infrastructural = imperial
High despotic + high infrastructural = authoritarian

Imperial rulers frequently did not disrupt local cultures, local legal systems, and local institutions. Doing so would risk unrest and would be expensive. They instead would force the locals to pay tax or tribute.

### Four Strategies of Imperial Rule

1. Direct rule by emperor's military force and bureaucrats: cannot do this everywhere!
2. Ideological conversion: create agents that identify with ruler through culture, education.
3. Provide public goods: induce compliance through better services (win hearts and minds)
4. Rule indirectly through local power structure as a tribute-paying vassal. Lowest cost, but also lowest level of control.

### Why Not Rule Through a Bureaucracy

- Relatively primitive agrarian economies with limited trade will not support a class of salaried bureaucrats
- Relatively primitive transportation and communications will not allow bureaucrats to cover extensive territority
- Relatively primitive techniques for recording and storing information

### Pre-Modern States

- In virtually all pre-modern polities:
	- Rulers, no matter how powerful, ruled indirectly, usually relying on local elites, supplementing them at times with elements of the army or directly appointed rulers.
- In these medieval states, local agents of ruler were also themselves locally powerful individuals who possessed some combination of political, military, and economic resources that made them valuable allies but also meant that they were rival rulers as well.


### Where We're Headed: The Development of the Modern State

1. Patrimonial States -> modern bureaucratic states.
2. Unconstrained, unaccountable, personal rule -> impersonal rule
3. Mediated rule -> Direct rule
4. Administrative and cultural homogeneity -> diversity

### The Puzzle of State Strength

**Patrimonial:** rulers claim absolute power and treated the state as personal property but are ultimately weak due to exercising very limited control over their population/territory/staff.

Contrast **despotic** versus **infrastructural** power.

### Resolving the Puzzle

The radius of conquest was always larger than the radius of administration: conquerors incorporated pre-existing power structures, while their delegated agents could amass considerable local autonomy.

**Principal-agent relations and loss of delegated power**: rulers and agents may have distinct interests; asymmetric information.

### Rise of the Modern State

- From patrimonial states to modern bureaucratic states
- From unconstrained, unaccountable, personal rule to impersonal administrative proceduralism and the rule of law.
- From mediated rule to direct rule
- From administrative and cultural heterogeneity to administrative and cultural uniformity

### Key Factors in Modern State Formation

1. Centralization of power
2. Institutionalization of power (substitution of civil servants governed by law for powerful local elites as agents of the state)
3. Increased extraction of resources
4. Increased regulation of society

### Protestant Reformation and State Building

- Cultural changes produce new forms of behavior resulting in stronger states.
Protestant reformation -> theological pressure for social discipline -> solution to principal-agent problems -> state building
Max Weber
Contemporary Version: Philip Gorski

### The Commercial Revolution & State Building

- The emergence of a new class of proto-capitalists - merchants, manufacturers, and financiers - who bargain with rulers to create the political conditions for greater wealth
Economic revival -> demand for public goods -> formation of preferences over institutions -> coalitions with political entrepreneurs -> state building

Karl Marx
Contemporary Version: Hendrik Spruyt, *The Sovereign State and its Competitors*

### The Military Revolution & State Building

- Given a European state system characterized by fragmented sovereignty, rulers under intense pressure to extract more resources from society and to centralize their rule.

>[!info] Military Revolution and State Building
Military Revolution -> Increased Pressure on Rulers -> Increased Demand for Revenue & Soldiers -> State building

### What Happened?

1. Changes in the "Art of War"
	1. massed, professional, disciplined infantry replace calvary
	2. "arms race" between development of cannon and development of advanced fortifications
2. Doubling (or more) of size of military relative to population and government revenues
3. Shift from customary dues and irregular taxes to regular direct taxes

### What Happened? Mechanisms?

- Predation: confiscation through violence
- Bargaining and the creation of new institutions
	- towns and cities: money and militias for legal autonomy, institutional reforms, mercantilism
	- church loses autonomy to rulers in exchange for reforms and state support in Protestant countries, counter reformation in Catholic countries
	- nobilities:
		- provincial nobilities exempted from taxes in Spain
		- local nobilities given access to state offices in France
		- political centralization and sovereignty for unconditional control over land sometimes labor from Eastern Europe/Russia
Balance between predation and bargaining shifts towards bargaining in the west, remains primarily predatory in the east.

### Why was Western Europe Different?

Outside of western Europe (China, Japan, India, Russia, Ottoman Empire, Persia), rulers had incentives to fight wars and access to military technology; but dynamics of warfare they confronted did not stimulate the dynamic cycle between Arms, Money, and Bureaucracy.

While Europe was fragmented into hundred of polities, China remained a unified empire and fought internal wars, not wars against other sovereign states.

Furthermore, China external wars were fought against nomads, against whom traditional and less expensive forms of military technology were superior.

### Looking Forward: Post-Colonial States

Why are post-colonial states in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia weaker on average than European states---again, strength is being measured in terms of infrastructural power---even as they are stronger than local ruling organizations had been into the 19th century.
