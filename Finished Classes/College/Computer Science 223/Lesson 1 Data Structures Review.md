## *Data*
The word "data" originates from the Latin meaning "something given" or "a thing granted" (information)

The word "data" is plural. The singular is "datum"
'22' the age of a student is a datum. Whereas `[22,24,19,...]` age of every student in this class is data.

## *Collection*

When you have a collection
- Figure out what you plan to do with it
	- You can sort it
	- You can add to it/remove from it
	- etc.
- Arrange them in a way that makes it easier for you to do whatever you want to do

>*Strategies for arranging this in memory* based on the type of operations we want to perform (idea).

>[!book] "Containers"
>*Tangible implementation* which allows us to store *Collections* (of things) as per selected strategy (implementation).

## *Course Overview*

- Different strategies for *arranging* collections in the computer's memory, based on the *intended* operations.
- *Pros and Cons* of different strategies and how to compare them.
- *Breaking down a problem* in a way to identify the memory organization strategy (data structure) that helps us solve it efficiently
- (Hands-on) How to *implement/utilize containers* that follow said strategies.
- *Algorithms* that go hand in hand with these data structures.
- Ways to *analyze* data structures and algorithms.
