	- Intro to G++
- A simple hello world demonstration (if there's time)

## *Driver*

A *device driver* is a computer program that allows the computer operating system to communicate with hardware.

*OEM* - Original Equipment Manufacturer
This is who/what decides the language uses/understands.

The "Boss", the thing that controls all the device drivers, is called *Kernel*. Core of the computer's operating system, has complete control.

The person/thing you communicate with to talk to the Kernel is called the *"Shell"*

*Terminal* is the display/communicative tool that lets you get to Shell. Zero intelligence.

*Terminal Emulators* are software simulations of the terminal device, When we run a terminal, we are actually running the terminal emulator.

Linux is *JUST A KERNEL*

GNU is the user tools. so its called GNU/Linux

There's a lot of Linux distro's (variations) out there.

Linux was modeled after Minix (stripped down UNIX clone), but is *NOT* UNIX.

Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than it's creators.

## *Compiler*
