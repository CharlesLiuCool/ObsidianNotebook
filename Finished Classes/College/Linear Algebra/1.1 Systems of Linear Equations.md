### Definition

A *linear equation* in variables ${x_1, x_2, ... x_n}$ is any equation in the form
$${a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3 +...+a_nx_n = b}$$

### Remark
1. ${x_1, x_2, ... x_n}$ are all variables.
2. ${a_1, a_2, ... a_n}$ are the coefficients (real numbers).
3. ${b}$ is a constant (a real number).
4. None of the variables are raised to any exponent (other than 1).
5. There are no roots, trigonometric, exponential, or other more complicated that we have learned about involving variables.
6. None of the variables are products or quotients with another.
