**Definition 5.7.1** (Vector space). A set ${V}$ is said to be a vector space over a field ${F}$ if ${V}$ is commutative group under addition and, if for each ${a \in F}$ and ${v \in V}$, there is an element ${av \in V}$ such that the following conditions hold for all ${a,b \in F}$ and all ${u,v \in V}$.

1. ${a(v+u) = av + au}$
2. ${(a+b)v = av + bv}$
3. ${a(bv) = (ab)v}$
4. ${1v = v}$

The elements in ${V}$ are called vectors while the elements from ${F}$ are called scalars.

**Example 5.7.2.** The set
$${\Bbb{R}^n = \{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\,|\,a_i \in \Bbb{R}\}}$$
is a vector space over ${\Bbb{R}}$. Where the operations are elementwise addition and scalar multiplication.

**Definition 5.7.5** (Subspace). Let ${V}$ be a vector space over a field ${F}$ and let ${U}$ be a subset of ${V}$. We say that ${U}$ is a *subspace* of ${V}$ if ${U}$ is also a vector space over ${F}$ under the operations of ${V}$.

**Definition 5.7.6** (Linear independence). A set ${S}$ of vectors is said to be *linearly dependent* over the field ${F}$ if there are vectors ${v_1,...,v_n}$ from ${S}$ and elements ${a_1,...,a_n}$ from ${F}$, not all zero, such that ${a_1v_1+...+a_nv_n = 0}$.
If a set of vectors is not linearly dependent, then we say they are *linearly independent*.

**Definition 5.7.7** (Basis). Let ${V}$ be a vector space over ${F}$. A subset ${B}$ of ${V}$ is called a basis for ${V}$ if ${B}$ is linearly independent over ${F}$ and every element of ${V}$ is a linear combination of elements of ${B}$.
