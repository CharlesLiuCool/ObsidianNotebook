**Definition 5.2.1** (Zero divisors). A *zero-divisor* is a nonzero element ${a}$ of a commutative ring ${R}$ such that there is a nonzero element ${b \in R}$ with ${ab = 0}$

**Definition 5.2.2** (Integral domain) An *integral domain* is a commutative ring with unity and no zero-divisors.

**Theorem 5.2.6** Let ${a,b,c}$ belong to an integral domain. If ${a \neq 0}$ and ${ab = ac}$ then ${b = c}$.

**Definition 5.2.7** (Characteristic of a ring). The *characteristic* of a ring is the least positive integer such that ${nx = 0}$

**Theorem 5.2.9** The characteristic of an integral domain is ${0}$ or prime.
