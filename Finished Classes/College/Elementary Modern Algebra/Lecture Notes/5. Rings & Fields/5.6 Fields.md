**Definition 5.6.1** A *field* is commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element is a unit.

**Theorem 5.6.2** A finite integral domain is a field.

**Corollary 5.6.3** For every prime ${p}$, ${\Bbb{Z}_p}$ is a field.

**Example 5.6.4** Let

${\begin{align} \Bbb{Z}_3[i] &= \{a + bi \,|\, a,b \in \Bbb{Z}_3\}  \\ &= \{0,i,2i,1,1+i,1+2i,2,2+i,2+2i\} \end{align}}$

This is a field with ${9}$ elements.

**Example 5.6.5** The real numbers with regular addition and multiplication form a field.
