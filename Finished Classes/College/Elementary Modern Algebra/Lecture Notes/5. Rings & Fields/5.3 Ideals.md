**Definition 5.3.1** (Ideal) A subring ${A}$ of a ring ${R}$ is called a (two-sided) *ideal* of ${R}$ for every ${r \in R}$ and every ${a \in A}$ both ${ra}$ and ${ar}$ are in ${A}$.

An ideal is called *proper* if the subring is a proper subring.

A subring ${A}$ of a ring ${R}$ is an ideal of ${R}$ if ${A}$ "absorbs" the elements of ${R}$. That is, if ${rA = \{ra \,|\, a \in A\} \subseteq A}$ and ${Ar = \{ar \,|\,a \in A\} \subseteq A}$ for all ${r \in R}$.

**Theorem 5.3.2** (Ideal test). A nonempty subset ${A}$ of a ring ${R}$ is an ideal of ${R}$ if
1. ${a + b \in A}$ whenever ${a,b \in A}$
2. ${ra}$ and ${ar}$ are in ${A}$ whenever ${a \in A}$ and ${r \in R}$.

**Definition 5.3.6** (Principal ideal generated by an element). Let ${R}$ be a commutative ring with unity and let ${a \in R}$. The set
$${\langle a \rangle = \{ra \,|\, r \in R\}}$$
is an ideal of, ${R}$ called the *principal ideal* generated by ${a}$.

**Definition 5.3.7** (Ideal generated elements). Let ${R}$ be a commutative ring

**Theorem.** For a ring ${R}$ and an ideal ${I}$, ${R/I}$ is a field if and only if ${I}$ is maximal.
*Proof:*
"${\Rightarrow}$"


### **Exercises 5.3.1**

1. Prove that the ring
$${\Bbb{Z}[\sqrt{p}] = \{a + b\sqrt{p} \,|\,a,b \in \Bbb{Z}\}}$$
is an integral domain. You may assume that it is already a ring.

Commutativity

${(a_1 + b_1\sqrt{p})(a_2 + b_2 \sqrt{p}) = (a_2 + b_2 \sqrt{p})(a_1 + b_1\sqrt{p})}$
${a_1a_2 + (a_2b_1 + a_1b_2)\sqrt{p} + b_1b_2p}$

Unity
${1}$
So where ${a = 1, b = 0}$

${(a_1 + b_1\sqrt{p})(a_2 + b_2 \sqrt{p}) = 0}$
No zero divisors

2. Show that every nonzero element of ${\Bbb{Z}_n}$ is a unit or a zero divisor.

take element ${k}$
