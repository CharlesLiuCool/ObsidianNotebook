**Definition 4.4.1** We say that ${G}$ is the *direct sum of groups* (also known as the *inner direct product of groups*) ${H}$ and ${K}$ we write ${G = H + K}$ if ${H}$ and ${K}$ are normal subgroups of ${G}$, ${G = HK}$ and ${H \cap K = \{e\}}$.

The reason this is frequently called the inner direct product of groups is that we are starting with two subgroups of ${G}$, then forming ${G}$ as an inner direct product of those groups. Contrast this with our normal product of groups (also called the external product), where we take two potentially unrelated groups and use those to form an entirely new group.

**Example 4.4.2** Consider the dihedral group of ${6}$ elements, ${D_6}$. Let ${F}$ denote some reflection and let ${R_k}$ denote a rotation of ${k}$ degrees. Then
$${D_6 = \{R_0, R_{120}, R_{240}, F, R_{120}F, R_{240}F\} + \{R_0, R_{180}\}}$$

**Theorem 4.4.3** If a group ${G}$ is the internal direct product of a finite number of subgroups ${H_1, H_2, ... ,H_n}$, then ${G}$ is isomorphic to the external direct product of ${H_1, ... ,H_n}$

**Theorem 4.4.4** Every group of order ${p^2}$, where ${p}$ is prime, is isomorphic to ${\Bbb{Z}_{p^2}}$ or ${\Bbb{Z}_p \times \Bbb{Z}_p}$.

**Corollary 4.4.5** If ${G}$ is a group of order ${p^2}$, where ${p}$ is prime, then ${G}$ is commutative.

### **4.4.1 Exercises**

1. What is the order of the quotient group ${\Bbb{Z}_{60}/\langle 15 \rangle}$?

${\frac{60}{15} = 4}$

1. Explain why a non-commutative group of order ${8}$ cannot be the internal direct product of proper subgroups.

Any proper subgroups of the non-commutative group of order ${8}$ cannot have order coprime with ${8}$, so they must have order of ${2}$ or ${4}$.
