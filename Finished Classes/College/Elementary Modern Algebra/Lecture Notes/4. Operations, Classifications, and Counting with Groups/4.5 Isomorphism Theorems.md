>**Theorem 4.5.1** *(First isomorphism theorem)*. Let ${\phi}$ be a group homomorphism from ${G}$ to ${H}$. Then
>1. The kernel of ${\phi}$ is a normal subgroup of ${G}$,
>2. The image of ${\phi}$ is a subgroup of ${H}$
>3. The image of ${\phi}$ is isomorphic to the quotient group ${G/\text{ker} (\phi)}$
Furthermore, if ${\phi}$ is onto, then ${H \cong G/\text{ker}(\phi)}$

**Corollary 4.5.2** If ${\phi}$ is a homomorphism from a finite group ${G}$ to ${H}$, then ${|\phi(G)|}$ divides ${|G|}$ and ${|N|}$

1. The product SN is a subgroup of ${G}$
2. The subgroup ${N}$ is a normal subgroup of ${SN}$
3. The intersection of ${S \cap N}$ is a normal subgroup of ${S}$
4. The quotient group ${SN}$...(*finish typing*)

>**Theorem 4.5.4** *(Third isomorphism theorem)*. Let ${G}$ be a group and ${N}$ a normal subgroup of ${G}$. Then
>1. If ${K}$ is a subgroup of ${G}$ such that ${N \subseteq K \subseteq G}$, then ${G/N}$ has a subgroup isomorphic to ${K / N}$.
>2. Every subgroup of ${G/N}$ is of the form ${K/N}$ for some subgroup ${K}$ of ${G}$ such that ${N \subseteq K \subseteq G}$.
>3. If ${K}$ is a normal subgroup of ${G}$ such that ${N \subseteq K \subseteq G}$, then ${G/N}$ has a normal subgroup isomorphic to ${K/N}$
>4. Every normal subgroup of ${G/N}$ is of the form ${K/N}$ for some normal subgroup ${K}$ of ${G}$ such that ${N \subseteq K \subseteq G}$.
>5. If ${K}$ is a normal subgroup of ${G}$ such that ${N \subseteq K \subseteq G}$, then the quotient group ${(G/N)(K/N)}$ is isomorphic to ${G/K}$

>**Theorem 4.5.5** Every normal subgroup of a group ${G}$ is the kernel of a homomorphism of ${G}$. In particular, a normal subgroup ${N}$ is the kernel of the mapping ${g \to gN}$ from ${G}$ to ${G/N}$.
