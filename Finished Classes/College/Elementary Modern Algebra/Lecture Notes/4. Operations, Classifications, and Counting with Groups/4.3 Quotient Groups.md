**Definition 4.3.1** Let ${H \vartriangleleft G}$, then the set of left (right) cosets of ${H}$ in ${G}$ is a group, called the *quotient group* of ${G}$ by ${H}$ (or commonly the *factor group* of ${G}$ by ${H}$).

>**Theorem 4.3.2** Let ${G}$ be a group and let ${H}$ be a normal subgroup of ${G}$. The set ${G /H = \{aH \,|\,a \in G\}}$  is a group under the operation ${(aH)(bH) = abH}$

**Example 4.3.3** Let ${4 \mathbb{Z} = \{0,\pm 4, \pm 8, ...\}}$. To construct ${\Bbb{Z}/4\Bbb{Z}}$, we first must determine the left cosets of ${4\Bbb{Z}}$ in ${\Bbb{Z}}$. These are
$${\begin{align} 0 + 4\Bbb{Z} &= 4\Bbb{Z} \\ 1 + 4\Bbb{Z} &=  \{1,5,9,...;-3,-7,...\} \\ 2+4\Bbb{Z} &= \{2,6,10,...;-2,-6,...\}\\ 3+4\Bbb{Z} &= \{3,7,11,...;-1,-5,...\} \end{align}}$$

We can build an operation table

|                        | ${0 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${1 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${2 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${3 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ${0 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${0 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${1 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${2 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${3 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ |
| ${1 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${1 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${2 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${3 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${0 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ |
| ${2 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${2 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${3 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${0 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${1 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ |
| ${3 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${3 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${0 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${1 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ | ${2 + 4\Bbb{Z}}$ |

We can see from this table that ${\Bbb{Z}/4\Bbb{Z} \cong \Bbb{Z}_4}$. More generally, if for any ${n > 0}$ we have ${n \Bbb{Z}}$, then ${\Bbb{Z} / n\Bbb{Z}}$ is isomorphic to ${\Bbb{Z}_n}$.

>**Theorem 4.3.4** Let ${G}$ be a group with center ${Z(G)}$ if ${G/Z(G)}$ is cyclic, then ${G}$ is commutative.

*Proof:* 
Since ${G}$ being commutative is equivalent to ${Z(G) = G}$, it suffices to show that the only element of ${G/Z(G)}$ is the identity coset ${Z(G)}$. Let ${G/Z(G) = \langle gZ(G) \rangle}$ and let ${a \in G}$. Then there exists an integer ${i}$ such that ${aZ(G) = g^{i}Z(G)}$. This gives ${a = g^{i}z}$ for some ${z \in Z(G)}$. Since both ${g^{i}}$ and ${z}$ belong to ${C(g)}$, so does ${a}$. Because ${a}$ is an arbitrary element of ${G}$, we know that every element of ${G}$ commutes with ${g}$, so ${g \in Z(G)}$. Thus ${g(Z(G)) = Z(G)}$ is the only element of ${G/Z(G)}$.

>**Theorem 4.3.5** For any group ${G}$, ${G/Z(G)}$ is isomorphic to ${\text{Inn}(G)}$ (group of inner automorphisms of ${G}$).

>**Theorem 4.3.6** Let ${G}$ be a finite commutative group and let ${p}$ be a prime that divides the order of ${G}$. Then ${G}$ has an element of order ${p}$.
