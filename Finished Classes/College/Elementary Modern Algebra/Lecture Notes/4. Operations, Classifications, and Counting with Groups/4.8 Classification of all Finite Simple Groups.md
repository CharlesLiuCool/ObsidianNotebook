**Definition 4.8.1** (Simple group). A simple group is a non-trivial group whose only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself.

Any non-simple group can be broken into smaller groups by using the non-trivial normal subgroup and the quotient group. For finite groups, this leads to a unique factorization of groups into a product of simple groups. This is known as the Jordan-H$\text{\"o}$lder Theorem.

**Theorem 4.8.2** (Classification of all finite simple groups). Every finite simple group is isomorphic to one of the following groups:
- a member of one of four infinite classes of such, namely
	- the cyclic groups of prime order
	- the alternating groups of degree at least ${5}$
	- the groups of Lie type
	- the derived subgroup of the groups of Lie Type, such as the Tits group
- or one of the ${26}$ groups called the "sporadic groups"
