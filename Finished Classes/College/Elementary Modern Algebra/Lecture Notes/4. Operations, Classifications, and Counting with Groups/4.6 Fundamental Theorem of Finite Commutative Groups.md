>**Theorem 4.6.1** *(Fundamental theorem of finite commutative groups)* 
>
>Every finite commutative group is a product of cyclic groups of prime order. Moreover, the number of terms in the product and the orders of the cyclic groups are uniquely determined by the group.

**Corollary 4.6.2** If ${m}$ divides the order of a finite commutative group ${G}$, then ${G}$ has a subgroup of order ${m}$.

### **4.6.1 Exercises**

1. Determine all the homomorphic images of ${D_4}$ (the dihedral group) up to isomorphism.
${D_4 = \{e,r,r^2,r^3,s,sr^2,sr^3,\}}$

${D_4 \cong \Bbb{Z}_4 + \Bbb{Z}_4}$
${\phi: s^kr^s \to (s,k)}$

2. Prove that every group of order ${77}$ is cyclic.

Let ${G}$ have order ${77}$.
Then ${G}$ is either isomorphic to ${\Bbb{Z}_{77}}$ or ${\Bbb{Z}_{11} \times \Bbb{Z}_7}$. 
By Lagrange's Theorem, any subgroup of ${G}$ divides ${|G|}$. So if there is a proper non-trivial subgroup of ${G}$, then either ${H}$ has order ${7}$ or ${11}$. Either way, ${H}$ is cyclic.
Either case, using isomorphism theorem or internal product, ${G = HK}$ where ${K}$ has the other prime factor. Thus, ${G \cong H + K}$. Since the external product of cyclic groups that have order that are coprime, the group ${G}$ is cyclic.

3. Suppose that ${G}$ is a finite group and that ${\Bbb{Z}_{10}}$ is a homomorphic image of ${G}$. What can we say about ${|G|}$?

${|G| \,|\, 10}$, ${|G| \ge 10}$

4. Suppose that ${\Bbb{Z}_{10}}$ and ${\Bbb{Z}_15}$ are both homomorphic image of a finite group ${G}$. What can we say about ${|G|}$?

${|G| \,|\, 30}$, ${|G| \ge 30}$

5. Determine all homomorphisms from ${\Bbb{Z}}$ to ${S_3}$
