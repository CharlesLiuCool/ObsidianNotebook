**Definition 4.2.1** (Normal subgroup) A subgroup ${H}$ of a group ${G}$ is called a *normal* subgroup of ${G}$ of ${aH = Ha}$ for all ${a \in G}$. We denote this by ${H \vartriangleleft G}$.

**Theorem 4.2.2** (Normal subgroup test). A subgroup ${H}$ of ${G}$ is normal if and only if ${xHx^{-1} \subseteq H}$ for all ${x \in G}$.
*Proof:*
If ${H}$ is normal in ${G}$, then for any ${x \in G}$ and ${h \in H}$, there is an ${h' \in H}$ such that ${xh = h'x}$. Thus, ${xhx^{-1} = h'}$ and therefore ${xHx^{-1} \subseteq H}$.

Conversely, if ${xHx^{-1} \subseteq H}$ for all ${x}$, then letting ${x = a}$, we have ${aHa^{-1} \subseteq H}$ or ${aH \subseteq Ha}$. On the other hand, letting ${x = a^{-1}}$, we have ${a^{-1}Ha \subseteq H}$ or ${Ha \subseteq aH}$.
Thus, ${aH = Ha}$, and the subgroup ${H}$ is normal.

**Example 4.2.3** Every subgroup of a commutative group is normal.

**Example 4.2.4** The alternating group ${A_n}$ of even permutations is a normal subgroup of ${S_n}$.

**Example 4.2.5** Let ${H}$ be a normal subgroup of a group ${G}$ and ${K}$ be any subgroup of ${G}$. Then
$${HK = \{hk \,|\, h \in H, k \in K\}}$$
is a subgroup of ${G}$.

### **4.2.1 Exercises**
1. Let ${H = \{0,\pm 3, \pm 6, ...\}}$. Find all the left cosets of ${H \in Z}$.

${0H = \{0, \pm 3, \pm 6, ... \}}$
${1H = \{...-5, -2, 1, 4, 7 ...\}}$
${2H = \{...-4, -1, 2, 5, 8 ...\}}$

1. Let ${a}$ and ${b}$ be elements of a group ${G}$ and ${H}$ and ${K}$ be subgroups of ${G}$. If ${aH = bK}$, prove that ${H = K}$.

The identity element must exist in both ${H}$ and ${K}$. Thus, ${a \in bK}$ and ${b \in aH}$.
By properties of cosets, ${H = K}$.
