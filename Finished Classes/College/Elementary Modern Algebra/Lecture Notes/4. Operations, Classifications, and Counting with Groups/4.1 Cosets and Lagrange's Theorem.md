### **4.1 Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem**

**Definition 4.1.1** (Coset of ${H}$ in ${G}$). Let ${G}$ be a group and let ${H}$ be a nonempty subset of ${G}$. For any ${a \in G}$, the set ${\{ah \,|\, h \in H\}}$ is denoted by ${aH}$. Similar definitions for ${Ha}$ and ${aHa^{-1}}$.

When ${H}$ is a subgroup of ${G}$, the set ${aH}$ is called the *left coset* of ${H}$ in ${G}$ containing ${a}$, whereas ${Ha}$ is the *right coset*. For these the element ${a}$ is called the coset representative of ${aH}$(or ${Ha}$).

**Lemma 4.1.4** (Properties of Cosets). Let ${H}$ be a subgroup of ${G}$, and let ${a}$ and ${b}$ belong to ${G}$. Then,

1. ${a \in aH}$
2. ${aH = H}$ if and only if ${a \in H}$
3. ${(ab)H = a(bH)}$ and ${H(ab) = (Ha)b}$
4. ${aH = bH}$ if and only if ${a \in bH}$
5. ${aH = bH}$ or (exclusively) ${aH \cap bH \neq 0}$.
6. ${aH = bH}$ if and only if ${a^{-1}b \in H}$.
7. ${|aH| = |bH|}$
8. ${aH = Ha}$ if and only if ${H =aHa^{-1}}$
9. ${aH}$ is a subgroup of ${G}$ if and only if ${a \in H}$

**Definition 4.1.5** The *index* of a subgroup ${H}$ in ${G}$ is the number of distinct left cosets of ${H}$ in ${G}$. This is denoted ${|G : H|}$.

**Theorem 4.1.6** (Lagrange's Theorem). If ${G}$ is a finite group and ${H}$ is a subgroup of ${G}$, then ${|H|}$ divides ${|G|}$. The number of distinct left (right) cosets of ${H}$ in ${G}$ is ${|G|/|H|}$.

*Proof:* Let ${a_1H, a_2H, ... a_rH}$ denote the distinct left cosets of ${H}$ in ${G}$. First, note that every ${a\in G}$ belongs to a coset since ${a \in aH}$ and ${aH = a_iH}$ for some ${i}$. This gives that
$${G = a_1H \cup a_2H \cup ... \cup a_rH}$$
By the properties of the cosets we know that they are disjoint, thus
$${|G| = |a_1H|+ |a_2H| + ... + |a_rH|}$$
Again by the properties of cosets we have ${|a_iH| = |H|}$ giving that ${|G| = r|H|}$.

**Corollary 4.1.7** If ${G}$ is a finite group and ${H}$ is a subgroup of ${G}$, then ${|G:H| = |G|/|H|}$.

**Corollary 4.1.8** In a finite group, the order of each element of the group divides the order of the group.

**Corollary 4.1.9** A group of prime order is cyclic.

**Corollary 4.1.10** Let ${G}$ be a finite group, and let ${a \in G}$, then ${a^{|G|} = e}$.

**Corollary 4.1.11** For every integer ${a}$ and every prime ${p}$, ${a^p}$ mod ${p}$ = ${a}$ mod ${p}$.

**Theorem 4.1.12** For two finite subgroups ${H}$ and ${K}$ of a group, define the set
$${HK = \{hk \,|\,h \in H, k \in K\}}$$
Then ${|HK| = |H||K|/|H \cap K|}$

**Theorem 4.1.13** (Classification of groups of order ${2p}$). Let ${G}$ be a group of order ${2p}$, where ${p}$ is a prime greater than ${2}$. Then ${G}$ is isomorphic to ${\mathbb{Z}_{2p}}$ or ${D_p}$.
