**Definition 4.7.1** (Group action). Let ${G}$ be a group and ${X}$ is a set, then a (left) group action ${\alpha}$ of ${G}$ on ${X}$ is a function
$${\alpha: G \times X \to X,}$$
that satisfies the following two axioms:
1. Identity: ${\alpha(e,x) = x}$
2. Compatibility: ${\alpha(g,\alpha(h,x)) = \alpha(gh,x)}$

for all ${g, h \in G}$ and all ${x \in X}$.

Using the above definition one may show that an equivalent definition of group action is a group homomorphism from ${G}$ into the symmetric group of ${X}$.

**Definition 4.7.2** Let ${G}$ be a group acting on a set ${X}$. The *orbit* of an element ${x \in X}$ is the set of elements in ${X}$ to which ${x}$ can be moved by the elements of ${G}$. Symbolically, we write the orbit of ${x}$ as ${G \cdot x}$ and can be expressed as
$${G\cdot x = \{g\cdot x : g \in G\}}$$

The set of all orbits under the action is denoted ${X/G}$.

**Definition 4.7.4** (Stabilizer) Let ${G}$ be a group acting on ${X}$. The *fixed point set* of ${g}$ in ${X}$, denoted ${X_g}$, is the set of all ${x \in X}$ such that ${gx = x}$.

**Theorem 4.7.5** (Burnside's Theorem) If ${G}$ is a finite group acting on a set ${X}$ and let ${O(X)}$ denote the number of orbits of ${X}$. Then
$${O(X) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum\limits_{g \in G} |X_g|}$$

**Example**
${G = \{e,r,r^2, r^3\}}$
${X = \{\text{all square configurations}\}}$

| Element | \#  |
| ------- | --- |
| ${e}$       | ${16 = 2^4}$  |
| ${r}$       | ${2 = 2^1}$   |
| ${r^2}$     | ${4 = 2^2}$   |
| ${r^3}$     | ${2 = 2^1}$   |

*Apply Burnside's Theorem*
${O(X) = \frac{1}{4} (24) = 6}$
