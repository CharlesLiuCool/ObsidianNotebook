**Definition 2.5.1** The *dihedral group* ${D_n}$ is defined to be the group of possible symmetries of a ${n}$-sided regular polygon. We can view this symbolically as 
$${D_n = \{r,s\,|\,s^2 = e,r^n = e, srs = r^{-1}\}}$$

**Theorem 2.5.3.** Dihedral groups are non-commutative for ${n \ge 3}$.
The proof is similar to why the alternating groups are non-commutative. There is an example at ${n = 3}$, then all larger values of ${n}$ have this as part of them.

### 2.5.1 Exercises

1. Let ${\beta = (123)(145)}$. Write ${\beta^{99}}$ in disjoint cycle form.

${12}

2. Show that ${A_5}$ has ${24}$ elements of order ${5,20}$ elements of order ${3}$, and elements of order ${2}$.
