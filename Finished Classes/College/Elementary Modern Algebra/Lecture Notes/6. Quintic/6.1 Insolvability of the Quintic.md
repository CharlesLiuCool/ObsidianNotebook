**Question 6.1.1** What are the roots to ${f(x) = x^2 + 4x - 5}$

**Theorem 6.1.2** Given a polynomial ${ax^2 + bx + c}$, the roots are
$${\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$$

**Definition 6.1.4** A field ${E}$ is an *extension field* of a field ${F}$ in ${F \subset E}$ and the operations of ${F}$ are those of ${E}$ restricted to ${F}$.

**Theorem 6.1.5** (Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory). Let ${F}$ be a field and let ${f(x)}$ be a nonconstant polynomial in ${F[x]}$. Then there is an extension field ${E}$ of ${F}$ in which ${f(x)}$ has a zero.
