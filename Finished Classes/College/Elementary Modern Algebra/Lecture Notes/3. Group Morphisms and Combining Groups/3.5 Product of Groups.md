**Definition 3.5.1** Let ${G_1, G_2,...,G_n}$ be a finite collection of groups. The *external direct product* of ${G_1, G_2,...,G_n}$, written as ${G_1\times G_2\times...\times G_n}$ is the set of all ${n}$-tuples for which the ${i}$th component is an element of ${G_i}$ and the operation is component-wise.

Symbolically

$${G_1 \times ... \times G_n = \{(g_1,...,g_n)\}}$$

**Theorem 3.5.3.** Let ${G,H}$ be groups and ${E = \{e\}}$ be the trivial group, then ${G \times H \} 

**Theorem 3.5.5.** The order of an element in a direct product of a finite number of finite groups is the least common multiple of the orders of the components.

**Theorem 3.5.6** Let ${G}$ and ${H}$ be finite cyclic groups. Then ${G \times H}$ is cyclic if and only if ${|G|}$ and ${|H|}$ are relatively prime.

### **Exercises**
1. Show that ${G \times H}$ is commutative if and only if ${G}$ and ${H}$ are commutative.

${\{a,b\} \times \{c,d\} = \{ac,bd\}}$
${\{c,d\} \times \{a,b\} = \{ca,db}\}$

${\{a,b\} \times \{c,d\} = \{c,d\} \times \{a,b\}}$

${ac = ca, bd=db}$
elements in ${G}$ and ${H}$ commute.

If elements in ${G}$ and ${H}$ commute, then we can do the same thing above but backwards

1. Prove that ${\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}}$ is not cyclic.



2. Is ${\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_9}$ isomorphic to ${\mathbb{Z}_{27}}$?
No


5. Prove that complex numbers under addition are isomorphic to ${\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}}$

6. Find all subgroups of order ${4}$ in ${\mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4}$.
1 has order 4
2 has order 2
3 has order 4

<0,1> (0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)
<1,0>
<2,3>
<3,2>
<1,3>
<1,2>
<1,1>

1. Give an example of an infinite non-commutative group that has exactly ${6}$ elements of finite order.
