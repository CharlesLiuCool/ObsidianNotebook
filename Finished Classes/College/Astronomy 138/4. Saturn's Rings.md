### Planetary Rings

- Recall, gravitationally equilibrated moons not expected inside Roche limit.
- All four giant planets in solar system have ring systems.
- Made of lots of little particles orbiting planet

### Saturn's Rings: Composition

- Extend 2.5 times planet radius (about to Saturn's Roche limit), but only about ${100}$m thick.
- Made of ring particles made of ice size from microscopic to size of a car, made of almost ${100}$% water ice
- Each particle in its own Keplerian orbit (outer ring particles moving more slowly).

### Gaps in Saturn's rings

- All presumably caused by gravity of Saturn's many moons
- Some caused by unstable orbital resonances with moons outside
- Some caused by tiny moods inside.

### Spiral Waves in Saturn's Rings

- Orbital resonances also excite spiral density waves in the rings

### Origin and Fate of Saturn's Rings
- The rings are probably only about 100 million years old, much younger than Saturn.
