### Measuring Impact Energy

- The kinetic energy of the impactor determines the damage

### The Chixulub Event

- Asteroid that killed the dinosaurs

### The Tunguska Event

- Destroyed tens of millions of trees in Siberia

### The Torino Scale of Impact Hazard

- Determining how dangerous an impact is

### Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)

- An object whose orbit comes within ${1.3}$ AU of the sun
- Over ${37,000}$ known NE asteroids
- Most fall into sun in ${\sim10^7}$ but are replenished from the asteroid belt. Both because of ${3}$-body effects (e.g. orbital resonances)
- Contrast with this: orbital periods of order year
- A dangerous NEO will cross Earth's orbit many times before impact

### What Could We Do to Prevent a Future Impact

- Considerations:
	- Deflection or destruction?
	- Earth travels its diameter every ${7}$ minutes. Alter the asteroid's orbit to delay or advance its crossing of Earth's orbit by this amount, and it will miss
	- Don't want to break asteroid into pieces that are too large
	- Won't help to break asteroid if gravity reassembles it, need to give pieces escape velocity.

### Deflection Strategies

- Basic idea: Conservation of Momentum: Total ${mv = }$ constant
	- Two things come together
	- One thing comes apart
