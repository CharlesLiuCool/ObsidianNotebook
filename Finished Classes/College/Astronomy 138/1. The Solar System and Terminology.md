*Solar System Data: The Ecliptic*
- The path on which the sun moves across the sky
- Everything in the Solar system (planets, comets, etc.) is pretty close to the ecliptic on the orbital plane.
- All planets orbit in the same way (counterclockwise looking “down”)

*Properties of Orbital Motion*

- Orbits are ellipses with the sun at one focus (Kepler’s First Law)
- Length unit: AU (Astronomical Unit)

${a =}$ semimajor axis

${b =}$ semiminor axis

${e =}$ eccentricity

${i =}$ inclination

${P =}$ period

*Additional information*

Astronomical Unit is the distance of the Earth to the sun (Earth’s orbit is roughly circular).
Eccentricity is how off the orbit is compared to a circle.

${e = \frac{d}{f}}$

${e = 0}$ means the orbit is a circle

${e}$ close to ${1}$ means it’s really stretched out.

Inclination of earth’s orbit is zero, the angle of how something else’s orbital plane is tilted compared to ours is another thing’s inclination.

Period is how long the thing takes to do one orbit.

${d_{a1} + d_{a2} = d_{b1} + d_{b2}}$

*Components of the Solar System*
- Terrestrial Planets: Close to the sun (made of rock)
- Gas Giants: Farther from the sun (made of gas)

  

*Solar System Scales*

- Sun radius / Earth radius = 109
    
- AU / sun radius = 215
    
- Neptune orbit / AU = 30
    
- Kuiper belt / AU = 30 to 50
    
- Heliopause (“hp”) / AU = 120
    
- Oort cloud / hp = 20 to 800
    
- Nearest star / hp = 2100
    

  

Orbital Mechanics: The Force of Gravity

- Planets trapped in the solar system by the force of the sun’s gravity
    
- In the absence of forces, a body will move with constant velocity
    
- Velocity = speed + direction; unit = m/s
    
- Force creates acceleration = change of velocity per time; unit = m/s2
    
- a = F/m; force unit = kg m/s2
    
- Gravity is an attractive force; any two masses are pulled toward each other
    

  

Newton’s Laws

First Law: An object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by an external force

Second Law: F = ma

Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

  

Gravity of an Extended Body

- Each piece of the Earth exerts a force on me. Arrows add (some cancel).
    
- Overall force is toward the center of the Earth
