## **Unit 2: Radiation and Observation**

### **Potential Energy From Other Attractive Forces**

- There is potential energy from the electric force, e.g. attraction of electrons to nuclei (protons) in atoms
- There is potential energy from the nuclear force, attraction of protons (nucleons) held together in atomic nuclei
- Both atoms and their nuclei are bound systems.

### **Why Is It So Hot Inside Planets?**

- Earth core temperature ${> 5000K}$. Why?
- *Primordial Heat:* Source = gravitational potential energy
- *Radiactivity:* Source = nuclear potential energy
- About equal contribution from each

### **Electromagnetic Waves**
- Other ways to describe color:
	- time between peaks of electric field at a particular location
	- 1/this time = frequency
	- blue = high frequency

### **Types of Spectra**

- continuous: all colors, no jumps
- *Emission line:* bright at certain specific colors (much darker at slightly higher or lower wavelength/photon energy)
- *Absorption line:* like a continuous spectrum, but dark at certain specific colors (i.e. take continuous spectrum and then subtract brightness at particular wavelengths/photon energies).

### **Where Do Emission Line Spectra Come From?**

- hot, low-density gas (e.g. atmospheres)

### **Blackbody Radiation Continuous Spectrum**

- hot thick gas or solid emits *blackbody radiation*
- spectrum only depends on temperature
*Blackbody laws:*
hotter ${\implies}$ brighter
hotter ${\implies}$ bluer

### **Blackbody Power**

- Object with surface area ${A}$, surface temperature ${T}$, will radiate energy per time (power).

$${L = \sigma AT}$$

- Total radiated power is called *luminosity* ${L}$.

### **Where Do Absorption Line Spectra Come From**

- Light from hot dense cloud passes through cooler gas, specific light wavelength gets absorbed and dims.

### **Spectral Lines**

- A gas will emit and absorb at same wavelengths/photon energies. E.g. hydrogen:

**Fingerprint of elements**
- each element has its own distinct spectral lines
- can infer composition of distant gas from its light (thanks to Kirchhoff)

>*Kirchhoff's Laws* only apply to *emission*.
