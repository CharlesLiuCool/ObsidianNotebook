## **Kirkwood Gaps**

___

Your task is to *(1)* identify six Kirkwood gaps in this histogram, *(2)* calculate how long a hypothetical object inside the gap would take to orbit the Sun once, and *(3)* check that this object's orbit time is in resonance with Jupiter. *(4)* Lastly, write a Chicago-style reference for this web page.

*First Gap*
The first gap is at a distance of ${2.05\text{AU}}$. Using the formula, I calculate an orbit time ${= 2.05^{\frac{3}{2}}= 2.935}$ years, in other words, a hypothetical asteroid at a distance of ${2.5 \text{AU}}$ from the Sun would orbit the Sun once every ${2.935 \text{ years}}$. To check for resonance, I divide into Jupiter’s orbit time of ${11.86 \text{ years}; 11.86 \text{ years} / 2.935 \text{ years} = }$ (years divided by years produces a unitless quantity). Or, I could write ${11.86:2.935 = 4.04:1.00}$. The simple ratio is therefore ${4:1}$. In other words, for every three asteroid orbits, Jupiter orbits exactly once. I have thus verified the ${4:1}$ orbit resonance.

*Second Gap*
The second gap is at a distance of ${2.5\text{AU}}$. Using the formula, I calculate an orbit time ${= 2.5^{\frac{3}{2}}= 3.95}$ years, in other words, a hypothetical asteroid at a distance of ${2.5 \text{AU}}$ from the Sun would orbit the Sun once every ${3.95 \text{ years}}$. To check for resonance, I divide into Jupiter’s orbit time of ${11.86 \text{ years}; 11.86 \text{ years} / 3.95 \text{ years} = 3.00}$ (years divided by years produces a unitless quantity). Or, I could write ${11.86:3.95 = 3.00:1.00}$. The simple ratio is therefore ${3:1}$. In other words, for every three asteroid orbits, Jupiter orbits exactly once. I have thus verified the ${3:1}$ orbit resonance.

*Third Gap*
The third gap is at a distance of ${2.82\text{AU}}$. Using the formula, I calculate an orbit time ${= 2.82^{\frac{3}{2}}= 4.74}$ years, in other words, a hypothetical asteroid at a distance of ${2.82 \text{AU}}$ from the Sun would orbit the Sun once every ${4.74 \text{ years}}$. To check for resonance, I divide into Jupiter’s orbit time of ${11.86 \text{ years}; 11.86 \text{ years} / 4.74 \text{ years} = 2.502}$ (years divided by years produces a unitless quantity). Or, I could write ${11.86:4.69 = 5.00:1.998}$. The simple ratio is therefore ${5:2}$. In other words, for every three asteroid orbits, Jupiter orbits exactly once. I have thus verified the ${5:2}$ orbit resonance.

*Fourth Gap*
The fourth gap is at a distance of ${2.95\text{AU}}$. Using the formula, I calculate an orbit time ${= 2.95^{\frac{3}{2}}= 5.07}$ years, in other words, a hypothetical asteroid at a distance of ${2.95 \text{AU}}$ from the Sun would orbit the Sun once every ${5.07 \text{ years}}$. To check for resonance, I divide into Jupiter’s orbit time of ${11.86 \text{ years}; 11.86 \text{ years} / 5.07 \text{ years} = 2.339}$ (years divided by years produces a unitless quantity). Or, I could write ${11.86:5.07 = 7:2.99}$. The simple ratio is therefore ${7:3}$. In other words, for every three asteroid orbits, Jupiter orbits exactly once. I have thus verified the ${7:3}$ orbit resonance.

*Fifth Gap*
The fifth gap is at a distance of ${3.27\text{AU}}$. Using the formula, I calculate an orbit time ${= 3.27^{\frac{3}{2}}= 5.91}$ years, in other words, a hypothetical asteroid at a distance of ${3.27 \text{AU}}$ from the Sun would orbit the Sun once every ${5.91 \text{ years}}$. To check for resonance, I divide into Jupiter’s orbit time of ${11.86 \text{ years}; 11.86 \text{ years} / 5.91 \text{ years} = 2.006}$ (years divided by years produces a unitless quantity). Or, I could write ${11.86:5.07 = 2:0.997}$. The simple ratio is therefore ${2:1}$. In other words, for every three asteroid orbits, Jupiter orbits exactly once. I have thus verified the ${2:1}$ orbit resonance.

*Sixth Gap*
The six gap is at a distance of ${3.97\text{AU}}$. Using the formula, I calculate an orbit time ${= 3.97^{\frac{3}{2}}= 7.91}$ years, in other words, a hypothetical asteroid at a distance of ${3.27 \text{AU}}$ from the Sun would orbit the Sun once every ${7.91 \text{ years}}$. To check for resonance, I divide into Jupiter’s orbit time of ${11.86 \text{ years}; 11.86 \text{ years} / 7.91 \text{ years} = 1.499}$ (years divided by years produces a unitless quantity). Or, I could write ${11.86:7.91 = 3:2.001}$. The simple ratio is therefore ${3:2}$. In other words, for every three asteroid orbits, Jupiter orbits exactly once. I have thus verified the ${3:2}$ orbit resonance.
