___

1. For the lunar lowlands image, report your crater count (number of craters), land area ( sq km), and cratering density (# of craters per million sq km). Report the same data for the lunar highlands image.
2. Which area has more cratering, lowlands or highlands? Which area has the older surface, lowlands or highlands?
3. "Age" means "the time since the surface rock became solid". Explain why older surfaces have a higher number of accumulated impact craters.
4. Using the age table, approximately how old is the surface near the Apollo 11 landing site? near the Apollo 16 landing site?
5. Fill in the missing numbers in the third column of the table.  What is meant by the column's title, "rate of formation"?
6. The last row of the table (4.4 billion years) is farther in the past than the first row (3.0 billion years).  Look at the third column.  Write a sentence describing how the rate of formation of new craters has changed over time (e.g., was the impact rate higher in the more distant past? lower? same?)
