Energy is *conserved*, the total amount of energy in an isolated system is constant.

Orbital energy ${E = E_k = E_g}$

$\large { E < 0 \implies }$ *bound*
${E > 0 \implies}$ *unbound*

${E = 2 \implies}$ passing through solar system
${E = 0.01 \implies}$ weakly bound, goes far from sun
${E = -10 \implies}$ strongly bound, always close to the sun
