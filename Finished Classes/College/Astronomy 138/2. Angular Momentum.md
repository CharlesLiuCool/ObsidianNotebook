*Conservation of angular momentum*
${J = mvr}$
${J =}$ orbit motion + spin motion
no torque ${\implies J}$ constant
shrink ${\implies}$ spin up

*Tidal Forces*
- Suppose an extended body in the gravitational field of a companion (e.g. Earth experiencing the gravitational pull of the moon)
- Force of moon's gravity.

- Suppose an extended body in the gravitational field of a companion (e.g. Earth experiencing the gravitational pull of the moon)
- Subtracting of the average

*Effect of Tidal Forces: Tidal Disruption*

Close enough to a planet, tidal forces can be stronger than self-gravity for an orbiting moon. This distance from the planet is called the *Roche limit*. Inside the Roche limit, objects will not clump together due to gravity, and existing bodies can be *tidally disrupted*, i.e. have matter pulled off of them. Inside the Roche limit, expect to find rings rather than moons.

*Effect of Tidal Forces: Tidal Torque*

- Suppose moon orbiting planet, with planet's rotation period shorter than orbital period. Fast planet spin causes tidal bulge to get ahead of moon.
- Gravity of moon pulls back on the tidal bulge.

- Planet also induces tidal bulge on moon and a tidal torque. Moon's spin slows until it achieves *synchronous rotation* ("tidally locked")
- All moons in solar system are tidally locked (why we only see one side of the moon)

Orbital period and orbital angular momentum of the moon if it were orbiting at distance ${d = R_ + R_m}$ between center of moon and and center of Earth.
