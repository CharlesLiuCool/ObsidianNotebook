### Lagrange Points

At Jupiter-sun ${L_4, L_5}$ points

### Orbital Resonances

- How can small pulls from one planet/moon affect the orbit of another?
- Pulls strongest when bodies closest
- In general, this happens at different points in orbit, so pulls cancel out.
- For a strong cumulative effect, need each pull to add.

*Resonance:* Drive an oscillatory system at its natural frequency
Example: Pushing a child on a swing
${f_{\text{push}} = f_{\text{swing}}}$ works
${f_{\text{push}} = \frac{1}{2}f_{\text{swing}}}$ also works.

Orbital Resonances: ${2}$ bodies orbiting a larger object, the ratio of their orbital periods reduces to a fraction with small numbers.

E.g. Europa and Ganymede, moons of Jupiter:

${P_\text{Europa} = 3.5}$ days ${, P_{\text{Ganymedge}} = 7}$ days, ${\dfrac{P_\text{Europa}}{P_\text{Ganymede}} = \dfrac{3.5}{7} = \dfrac{1}{2}}$.

E.g. Neptune and Pluto

${P_{\text{Neptune}} = 165}$ yr, ${P_{\text{Pluto}} = 248}$ years, ${\dfrac{P_\text{Neptune}}{P_{\text{Pluto}}} = \dfrac{2}{3}}$

- That's a huge coincidence right? This happens because resonances are sometimes stable, and planets/moons can be locked into them.
- More often, resonances are unstable
