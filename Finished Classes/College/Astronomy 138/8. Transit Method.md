If orbital plane is seen nearly edge-on, the planet will eclipse the star, blocking part of its light. At this time, the star's brightness will appear to dip.
Wait for a few transits to be sure it's a planet, not stellar variability, and to get orbital period.
Bigger planet, closer to its star, leads to bigger dip ${\implies}$ get planet radius
