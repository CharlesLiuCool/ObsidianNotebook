${\dfrac{dy}{y^2(1-y)} = dx}$

>[!question] Example 4
>The population of frogs in a pond is modeled by:
>$${\dfrac{dP}{dt} = 2P (100-P)}$$

>[!check]- Solution
>Suppose 5 frogs are added to the pond every time step. What is the stable population of frogs.
>
${\dfrac{dP}{dt} = 2P(100-P) + 5 = 0}$
>
${= 200P - 2P^2 + 5 = 2P^2 - 200P - 5 = 0}$
> 
> ${p = \dfrac{200 \pm \sqrt{200^2 + 4\cdot 2\cdot 5}}{4} = 50 \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{40000+40}}{4} = 50 \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{10,010}}{2}}$
